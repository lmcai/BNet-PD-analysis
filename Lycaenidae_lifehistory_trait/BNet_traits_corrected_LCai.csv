Evans (1957) recorded that 187 species were classified under the Arhopala group. However, the number of species is now probably more accurately stated as being over 200 because, as predicted by Corbet (1946), new Arhopala species have since been discovered and various taxa are now considered to be distinct, not merely races of certain species (e.g. see below). Large numbers of species exist, especially in India, Burma, Malaya and NG. For example, Corbet and Pendlebury (1978) recorded over 108 species in Malaya, and about 40 species are, to date, known from PNG, many of which also occur in Irian Jaya. A further 2 species present in Irian Jaya are not yet known from PNG. Only 4 species occur in Australia, all of which also occur in NG. The type species for Arhopala is phryxus Boisduval, 1832, designated by Butler, 1875. Hemming (1967: 58) discussed, in detail, the nomenclature relating to this species. Arhopala is predominantly a lowland genus. Corbet (1946) found that, of the 82 Malayan species known at the time, only 8 (10%) did not exist below 820 m, whilst 63 (77%) were not found above this altitude. In PNG, nearly all species occur at, or down to, elevations little above sea level. However, only arta has been recorded as high as about 1,600 m. Five species apparently range up to 50 m elevation, 8 to 200 m, 9 to 500 m, 9 to 800 m, 2 to 1,000 m, and 6 to 1,200 m. Thus, as in Malaya, 77% of Arhopala in PNG do not occur above about 800 m. Corbet noted that Malayan Arhopala are practically confined to primary forest, although he also observed that, in northern Malaya and Burma, some species frequent secondary vegetation. The latter is the prevailing habitat type for Arhopala in NG. Corbet pointed out that all Arhopala species, except A. centaurus, are rare in Malaya, especially in the north. In PNG, most Arhopala species can be classed as rare generally, but occasional to common locally. Bethune-Baker (1903a) published the first comprehensive revision of Arhopala and this contains useful text, figures and colour plates. The most recent revision of Arhopala is still that of Evans (1957), who treated the genus as 5 separate genera and listed Iois Doherty, 1889, as a synonym of Arhopala (sensu Evans, 1957). However, recent authors, such as Corbet and Pendlebury (1978), D’Abrera (1978) and Common and Waterhouse (1981), have all preferred to follow Corbet (1946) who treated all species listed by Evans as belonging to the single genus Arhopala. This arrangement is also employed here. Therefore, the following must all be regarded as being synonyms of Arhopala: Mahathala Moore, 1878; Narathura and Thaduka Moore, 1879; Nilasera Moore, 1881; Panchaia Moore, 1882; Apporasa, Satadra, Darasana and Acesina Moore, 1884; Flos Doherty, 1889; Aurea Evans, 1957. Nevertheless, these taxa were retained at the genus level by Eliot (1973), who treated Arhopala under the tribe Arhopalini Bingham, 1907. The use of the generic name Amblypodia Horsfield, 1929 (which is currently applied to a separate group of butterflies, e.g. A. annetta: see Genus Amblypodia), instead of Arhopala, was clarified in detail by Evans (1957: 133). Arhopala range from fairly small to medium-sized species (lycaenids that are, therefore, large, considering the family as a whole). Throughout their range their undersides are predominantly cryptically mottled with brown, but a few NG species are obviously mimetic of unrelated, more brightly patterned lycaenids (see Chapter 8). The adults are robustbodied, strong-winged lycaenids which usually bear a short, curved HW tail at the end of vein CuA2, although this is completely absent in some species. Some species also possess a hindwing tornal lobe which usually bears a black eye-spot. A weaker black eye-spot may also be present above the base of the tail. The area between these is often iridescent pale blue, the extent of this usually being very individually variable. The Arhopala male lacks sex-brands, but species are usually fairly sexually dimorphic. The male upperside is usually extensively mauve or iridescent blue, with narrow dark brown margins. The female is duller, with less extensive, duller blue upperside scaling and much broader dark brown margins, and the underside is usually paler than that of the male. Most Arhopala tend to resemble one another. However, their underside patterns are generally a good guide to identifying taxa as these vary from species to species, but are usually almost identical in both sexes. As pointed out by Corbet (1946), Evans (1957) and Corbet and Pendlebury (1978), Arhopala male genitalia are all very similar and so are not very helpful in making species determinations (a condition analogous to that of Delias of the Pieridae). The genitalia of some Arhopala species are also somewhat variable. Corbet and Pendlebury suggested that frequent natural hybridisations might occur in Malaysian Arhopala, which would add to the confusion regarding their taxonomy. However, this has not been observed in PNG species. Another problem in the identification of species in ‘difficult’ species groups (such as the centaurus species group covered in this work) is that they are also phenotypically variable, often to quite a degree, so that some forms of each species tend to resemble each other. This variability is often manifested at both the regional and local level. For example, the hue of the upperside blue or mauve ground colour in males, and the width of their dark brown wing margins, often varies in this way, as do the widths of the underside markings in both sexes. Where species exhibit such variability then an attempt has been made to illustrate the main forms. The Arhopala eye is naked and the antenna has a gradual cylindrical club with more than 40 segments. The labial palpus is clothed with appressed scales and bears a short apical segment. The male foreleg tarsus is fused into a single segment, which is more or less stubby-tipped, but which is often slightly recurved, and briefly, but bluntly, pointed. The forewing bears 11 veins. Veins Mj and R5 are separate, and M2 arises much closer to M1 than M4. Adult Arhopala are all very similar in their habits. They rest for much of the time, wings folded, on the uppersides of the leaves of marginal vegetation from 2-8 m above ground. They are, therefore, very difficult to see because of their cryptic brown undersides. Only when disturbed are the brilliant blue uppersides of the adults seen. The flashing coloration and very rapid flight makes them difficult to follow with the eye. If disturbed, they usually quickly take flight and settle out of reach on higher perches, facing head downwards in order to survey the area below them. Corbet and Pendlebury (1978) noted that, when the sun disappears, adults often leave their lower perches and fly up into the forest canopy. However, they also pointed out that, as evening approaches, some species become more active and take up favoured positions on the forest margin or in clearings, from where they dart at great speed on repeated excursions which always follow the same route. It is notable in PNG (and possibly, therefore, elsewhere), that Arhopala adults exhibit interspecific gregarious behaviour which may be protective in function (on the basis of ‘safety in numbers’: see Chapter 8). For example, in the Bulolo area (MoP) often up to 3 Arhopala species (e.g. chamaeleona, leander and philander), numbering several adults of each species, may be observed in certain areas using the same perching trees. The trees are apparently not utilised as larval foodplants, although the foodplants doubtless occur nearby. Labels on some specimens of Arhopala madytus in the KONE collection state that they were collected in the Port Moresby area (CeP) whilst perching in the company of Arhopala arta and Arhopala micale on nests of the ant Oecophylla smaragdina. Common and Waterhouse (1981) pointed out that madytus is found in the “same situations” as A. micale and A. eupolis in Australia. The early stages of a number of Arhopala species in the centaurus species group have been well documented and illustrated by various authors (e.g. Bell, 1919). They are all very similar to each other in PNG. Good colour plates of Arhopala early stages from Japan are included in Shirozu and Hara (1973). The larvae and pupae of many Arhopala species are known to be attended by Oecophylla smaragdina, the kurukum, tailor, or green tree ant (e.g. PI. 122). These and other ants ‘milk’ nectarlike secretions from the prominent dorsal organ of Arhopala larvae (e.g. PI. 123.3154). Arhopala larvae are extremely slow- moving. Mature larvae constaict loose shelters by silking together portions of the leaves of their foodplants, inside which they rest concealed. They feed on young leaves of trees in several different families, especially the oaks (Fagaceae). Evans (1957) divided the ‘Arhopala group’ into 16 natural groups. These are convenient species-group divisions and so are employed here. However, Eliot (1972) demonstrated that, on the basis of its external facies and male genitalia, Arhopala ate Hewitson, 1863, does not belong in the hercules species group as Evans had treated it, but in the democritus species group under the cleander subgroup. For similar reasons Arhopala antharita is here removed from Evans’ eumolphus species group to his anthelus species group, alongside its nearest relative Arhopala auxesia salvia. 8 species groups occur in PNG: anthelus, hercules, democritus, eumolphus, centaurus, fulla, thamyras and critala. The thamyras group was treated under the genus Arhopala (sensu Evans, 1957) and is here termed thamyras, from the oldest-named species in the group. Evans (1957) did not mention the 2 species of the critala group as they were not recognised as belonging to Arhopala at the time because of their very accurate mimicry of species in the lycaenid genus Danis (see Chapter 8). Only the fulla group in PNG contains species which all lack hindwing tails.",B_7418

It is very species rich in India, Burma, Malaysia and New Guinea. In the Australian faunal subregion, there are four species, all of which occur in the tropical zone. Larvae of three of these species are phytophagous, feeding on the foliage of many different dicotyledonous plants, and are attended by Oecophylla (Formicinae) ants. The fourth species (A. wildei) is myrmecophagous, its larvae feeding exclusively on immature stages of its attendant ant, Polyrhachis (Formicinae). Two species (A. micale, A. centaurus) in Australia feed on species in a wide range of plant genera from many families, including the Anacardiaceae, Boraginaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Clusiaceae, Combretaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Lauraceae, Loranthaceae, Lythraceae, Malvaceae, Meliaceae, Myrtaceae, Sapindaceae, Sterculiaceae and Verbenaceae. An unidentified larva has been found on Scolopia (Flacourtiaceae) (P.S. Valentine). It is likely that female oviposition behaviour and larval diet in these species is more dependant on the presence of the attendant ant than on food plant chemistry. Adults are robust, medium sized, usually with a shining blue upperside with black margins and a dull brown underside. In Arhopala, the antenna is relatively short, being less than half the length of the costa of the fore wing; the eye is smooth; the fore wing has 11 veins, with the radial branches R4 and Rs fused into a single vein R4+5; the hind wing has a short curved tail at the end of vein CuA2, and a weakly developed tornal lobe; the male lacks sex-scales.",B_7418

Eyes naked or with a sparse covering of very short hairs. Antennae of variable length; club gradual, slim or occasionally broad. Maxillary palpi absent. Labial palpi variable. Tarsal claws of all legs bifid. Forelegs normally developed and functional in both sexes; foretibia without an epiphysis. Mid and hindtibiae with terminal pair of spurs. Cell of both wings closed. Forewing Rs with two, three or four (most frequently three) branches; origin of M3 at or near posterior angle of cell, the cubitus appearing three-branched; one anal vein (1A+2A), with 2A usually separate at base. Hindwing humeral vein variable, sometimes absent; two anal veins (1A+2A and 3A). Male secondary sexual characters (brands, hair tufts or scattered androconia) usually present (fig. 7.2). Male eighth tergite often produced posteriorly, either as paired dorsolateral flaps or as a middorsal depressed sac (a pseuduncus). Male genitalia: tegumen often with an uncus anticus; a diffusely sclerotized subscaphium sometimes present; valvae not well sclerotized, often w ith an ampullary process arising from central part of medial wall, sometimes with distal processes, costa attached to tegumen by a distinct and usually well sclerotized band; aedeagus usually with a trochanter; vesica nearly always w ithout cornuti. Larvae do not form shelters. Pupae exposed, with a girdle. Most are of m edium size though a few, such as Leptosia, are small and fragile while members of the Oriental genus Hebomoia are larger than many Papilionidae. Unique among butterflies is the universal occurrence of bifid tarsal claws (fig. 7.1), otherwise found in only a few Papilionidae, Satyrinae, Acraeinae and Lycaenidae. The characteristic white and sulphurous yellows, and the reds of the more colourful tropical species, are produced by pteridine pigments that are found in few other Lepidoptera. Though pterins are now known to be derived from guanine nucleotides and not uric acid. Ford's modified murexide test (Ford, 1947), in which specimens are exposed to chlorine gas, is still a simple means of demonstrating these pigments. The test is conveniently done by placing the set specimen in a wet box with a small amount of household chlorine bleach for about 20 minutes. The bleached insect is then removed, allowed to dry and stored in the dark. A strong purplish pink tinge develops during the following few days (fig. 7.3). A singular feature of the male genitalia, possessed by many members throughout the family, is a sclerotized plate on the ventral surface of the aedeagus posterior to the caecum. Since it appears to be an area of muscle insertions Higgins (1975: 69) has named it the trochanter penis. The family contains about 1000 species distributed in all habitable regions. Of the four subfamilies the Dismorphiinae are mainly confined to the New World tropics and the Pseudopontiinae comprise a single aberrant west African species. Only the widely distributed and closely related Pierinae (about 700 species) and [Fig 7.1 Bifid claws on right hindleg of Cepora nerissa (SEM Scale bar indicates magnification)] [Fig. 7.2 Brush-tipped androconiumm at Pieris canidia (SEM Scale bar indicates magnification.)] [Fig. 7.3 Underside of Eurema hecabe before (A) and after (B) Ford's test.] Coliadinae (about 250 species) occur in the IndoAustralian Region. In most areas, including Hong Kong, one or two species associated with secondary growth or crops are the most common of all butterflies and at times attain epidemic proportions. The larvae of Pieris are important pests of cultivated Cruciferae, and in North America Colias eurytheme Boisduval is a pest of Alfalfa. Until the widespread use of insecticides Aporia crataegi Linnaeus was a pest of fruit trees in Europe. The family includes many migrants, among which the Catopsilia and Appias species are the best known and sometimes occur in huge swarms. Many Dismorphiinae are associated with the Heliconiini and other groups in mimicry rings, and Delias species are aposematic and known to be distasteful to captive birds. Larvae of Catopsilia and Pieris have been shown to sequester distasteful compounds from their foodplants and it is possible that these and other predominantly white Pieridae are aposematic or warningly coloured, form ing Batesian or Mullerian mimetic associations within the family and with other Lepidoptera. The eggs are white, yellow or orange and laid singly in the ma|ority of species. They are two or three times as tall as broad, rarely less, taper towards the micropylar area and [Fig. 7.4 Egg of Eurema hecabe, diameter 0.4 mm, height 1.2 mm.] [Fig. 7.5 Last instar larva of Catopsilia pomona on Cassia siamea, length 39 mm.] [Fig. 7.6 Pupa o f Pieris canidia on Tropaeolum majus, length 19 mm.] have variably developed vertical ridges and transverse striations. The larvae are slim and cylindrical and mostly procryptic green or green and yellow. Typically each segment is rugose and bears several bands of short conical tubercles, each ending in a simple small seta (e.g. Hebomota) or stout seta that ends in a thin-w alled spherical expansion (e.g. Eurema, fig. 3.15 B) These cuticular outgrowths extend over most of the head, which usually appears little different from the rest of the dorsal and lateral cuticle and is not concealed at rest. In a few, such as Cepora and Appias, the integum ent is partly unpigmented and the larger tracheae are visible. All pupae have a single cephalic horn and long tapering abdomen and are supported by a girdle. Many are suspended beneath an angled or horizontal surface like those of the Papilioninae; others are less particular about their posture and may be found at any angle, head upwards or downwards, or on top of or beneath a horizontal surface. Those of many species show great variation in colour, from bright green to shades of brow n or grey. Immature stages of the two subfamilies in Hong Kong show few consistent differences. Key to the Hong Kong subfamilies: Hindwing humeral vein long and curved outwards. Eggs with vertical ridges ending in low projections surrounding the micropylar area. Larval foodplants predominantly Capparaceae and Cruciferae. Pierinae Hindwing humeral vein short and curved inwards, or absent. Eggs with vertical ridges tapering oft before the micropylar area. Larval foodplants predominantly Leguminosae. Coliadinae.",B_16710

The taxon indicus Fruhstorfer, 1899 (TL: Tenasserim) is a synonym of ssp. hegesippus Cramer, 1777 (TL: w. Sumatra). RANGE. The species is distributed from N.E. India to Indochina and Taiwan, and southwards to the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and further to the Philippines, Sulawesi and Lesser Sunda Islands. The ssp. hegesippus (= indicus Fruhstorfer, 1899) occurs on the  Southeast Asian mainland, including Vietnam. DISTRIBUTION AND VARIATION IN VIETNAM, C. Vietnam: Bao Loc (SM); S.

Specimens of Vietnamese populations are slightly variable in size and wing pattern. Length of FW: both sexes 38-44 mm. TAXONOMIC NOTES. Fruhstorfer (1910) considered that the continental populations, distributed from Myanmar to Indochina, belong to ssp. indicus, which scarcely varies and differs from taxon hegesippus which is distributed in Sumatra, Malaya and adjacent Islands. In comparison with the Burmese and Malayan populations the Vietnamese specimens are characterised by higher melanism (Morishita, 1970). Later Morishita (1985) and Ackery & Vane-Wright (1984) extended the range of hegesippus to all mainland territories where the species had been recorded. Our studies confirm that in Vietnam the local populations include all variations typical to ssp. hegesippus though in Vietnam the proportion of melanic morphs is higher. HABITAT AND BIOLOGY. The species is not frequent and can be seen occasionally at the same lowland open habitats typical for D. genutia. Larval foodplants belong to the genera Gxmnema and Tylophora (Asclepiadaceae). Imagos are attracted by the flowers of Ageratum conxzoides (Asteraceae) and Lantana camara (Verbenaceae) (Ackery & Vane-Wright, 1984). SIMILAR SPECIES.

Of this group D’Abrera (1978) followed Seitz (1926) and recognised only D. epijarbas as occurring within the Australian Subregion. He treated several similar, but nevertheless distinct, species from the region as races of epijarbas. However, this is untenable and many of the supposed races have overlapping distributions. For example, the taxa epijarbas, diovis, littoralis and woodfordi are all sympatric in the Sogeri to Kokoda Trail area of the Central Province in PNG. The taxa epijarbas and diovis are also sympatric in northern Queensland, Australia (Cooper et al., 1993). Members of the group are characterised by their pale grey or pale brown undersides marked with fine white lines which delineate bands that are only slightly darker than the ground colour. The group ranges throughout the Indo-Australian Region from India as far eastwards as Samoa, and is typified by its most widespread species, epijarbas. Deudorix viridens Druce, 1891, which flies with D. woodfordi on Guadalcanal Island in the Solomons, and which has distinctive male genitalia, may eventually be located on Bougainville Island (NSP, PNG). The species in this group are all very similar. However, they are usually easily separable by comparison of the subtle differences in the patterns of their undersides. Other useful external features include the colour of the frons, the colour and maculation of the hindwing upperside tomal lobe, and the size and shape of the hindwing underside subtomal eye-spot. In combination, all of these characters are a good guide to species in this group. However, the epijarbas species group male genitalia (PI. XIV) provide the most certain means of species identification for that sex. These exhibit 4 important diagnostic characters: the frontal profile of the uncus (including the sinus), the size and distribution of the cornuti of the aedeagus, the size and shape of the pair of lateral cornutal blades below the aedeagus distal aperture, and the morphology of the valval apices. (The pair of lateral cornutal blades fold inwards if the vesica of the aedeagus is not distally everted to some extent, and this is obvious from some of the Figures.) The specific identities of the NG members of the epijarbas species group have been ascertained on the basis of the above-mentioned characters and, as far as possible, the correct names are applied to the taxa discussed below.

D. ninus continues the range of the genus eastwards through the Moluccas to mainland NG and Fergusson Island (MBP) in PNG. However, Corbet and Pendlebury (1978) considered that ninus is merely a race of nesimachus. This may be correct as the early stages of both taxa are similar (pers. obs.), although the adults are phenotypically rather distinct, which suggests that they are best maintained as separate species. Corbet and Pendlebury (1978: 205) treated Dichorragia as belonging to the subfamily Pseudergolinae (containing: Pseudergolis C. & R. Felder, 1867; Stibochiona Butler, 1868; Amnosia Doubleday, 1849; and Dichorragia), following the genus Lexias, and preceding the subfamily Apaturinae. They stated that: “The females of the included genera, except Amnosia, have the foretarsi clawed, a feature not found in other Nymphalid groups and, apparently previously unrecorded in the case of Dichorragia. The group appears to be more nearly related to Apaturinae than to any other subfamily, and should perhaps rank as one of its tribes.” Earlier, Bingham (1905) had noted that the main structural difference between Stibochiona and Dichorragia are the much shorter forewing and hindwing cells in Stibochiona. Otherwise the venation, shape and length of antennae and labial palpi, and hirsute eyes, are all like Dichorragia. Fruhstorfer (1912-15, in Seitz), had also included Dichorragia in his tribe Apaturidi, stating that the genus “represents a transition from the Euthaliidi to the Apaturidi”. He proposed that a relationship between Dichorragia and Apaturina is suggested by the closed cells of their wings and the distinct scaphium (sociuncus) of the tegumen of the male genitalia. Corbet and Pendlebury pointed out that the Dichorragia thorax is very robust, and that they are much more powerful fliers than other species of the Pseudergolis group of genera. The form of the Dichorragia larvae is clearly suggestive of the Apaturinae (see further discussion under Subfamilies Apaturinae and Nymphalinae). Ackery (1988), however, treated Dichorragia under the subfamily Limenitinae and tribe Pseudergolini. He maintained that records of Dichorragia feeding on the Meliosmaceae and Anacardiaceae, both members of the Sapindales, indicate some affinity with the true limenitines. The larval feeding behaviour of Dichorragia documented by Shirozu and Hara (1960-62) does bear out this possibility. The first instar larva moves to the apex of a leaf of its foodplant after eating away the top of the eggshell and leaving the base as a ring. In limenitine fashion, it then proceeds to eat back both sides of the leaf, leaving the mid-vein intact and affixing pieces of the leaf with silk to a 2-3 mm long section of the mid-vein on which it rests cryptically among the brown leaf fragments. The larva then progressively eats the leaf lamina backwards either side of the mid-vein, returning after each meal to rest at the apex. Shirozu and Hara noted that the young larval instars of Cyrestis thyodamas in Japan similarly affix faeces to the mid-vein which they leave intact and on which they rest cryptically, so this camouflage behaviour is obviously common to Apaturinae and limenitines. Dichorragia exhibits little sexual dimorphism. The cells of both wings are closed. The antennae are long, being over half the length of the forewing costa, the club long and cylindrical. The labial palpi are obliquely porrect and the eye is sparsely hirsute. Until now, only the early stages of Oriental D. nesimachus were known. They were photographically illustrated from Japan with colour plates by Shirozu and Hara (1960-62), the larval foodplants being various species of Meliosma (Meliosmaceae).

None. ■ Description. Wingspan: male 38 mm; female 40 mm. Upperside: cream-white; fore wing with a broad black apical patch which extends narrowly along costa and along termen to dorsum; hind wing often with a series of small black terminal streaks at end of veins. Underside: fore wing cream-white, with cell lemon-yellow, and a black subapical patch superimposed on a silvery-grey apical patch; hind wing pearly-white faintly suffused with cream or pale yellowish-orange. The female can be distinguished from the male by the presence of an obscure brown spot at the end of the cell on the underside of the hind wing, followed by a series of one to three faint brown postmedian spots; these spots are generally absent in the male. Also in the female the black apical patch on the upperside of the fore wing is usually slightly broader along the termen between veins CuAl and 1A+2A. ■ Variation. Seasonal variation is weak in this species, although wet- and dry-season forms are apparent. The above description refers to the ‘wet-season form’ (Plate 26, fig. 2a). The ‘dry-season form’ (Plate 26, fig. 2b) has the underside ground colour of the fore wing more extensively suffused with yellow, and the underside ground colour of the hind wing is pale brown or darker yellow-orange, the variation being more pronounced in the female than in the male. Both sexes of the cdry season form’ often have a small brown spot at the end of the cell on the underside of the fore wing, and in the male a similar spot is usually present on the underside of the hind wing. The ‘dry-season form’ is usually found only during the cooler months, from May to September at Millmerran, QLD (J. Macqueen). The seasonal variation possibly has thermoregulatory significance, but the factors inducing the phenotypic shift have not been established experimentally. In addition to seasonal differences in the underside ground colour, both sexes show variation in the shape of the apex of the fore wing, which may be distinctly pointed or slightly rounded. The extent of the black terminal streaks at the end of the veins on the upperside of the hind wing also varies. ■ Similar species. Elodina parthia (p. 311), E. angulipennis (p. 314), E. queenslandica (p. 315), E. walkeri (p. 316), E. perdita (p. 318), E. claudia (p. 319). E. padusa ‘wet-season form’ is similar to that of E. parthia in that the inner edge of the black apical patch on the upperside of the fore wing is strongly produced and angled, however, it is distinguished from that species by the narrower and more elongate fore wing with, on its underside, the lemon-yellow cell and a black subapical patch. The ‘dry-season form’ is readily distinguished from most other species of Elodina by the creamish-white upperside, and the pale brown or yellow- orange underside ground colour of the hind wing which, in freshly emerged specimens, has a pearly or glistening sheen. A similar underside ground colour is sometimes found in E. perdita females, but E. padusa can be easily distinguished by) the presence of a black subapical patch on the underside of the fore wing. ■ Immature stages. Egg: 1.0 mm high, 0.5 mm wide; white when laid, later changing to pink; elongate and spindle-shaped, with 16 fine longitudinal lines. Larva (Plate 68, fig. 10): 20 mm long; body pale green, with a faint yellow or white dorsal line; abdominal segments 2 and 8 with prominent reddish-brown dorsal tubercles; anal segment bifid; head green or reddish- brown. The larva completes only four instars (Fisher 1984b). Pupa (Plate 68, fig. 11): 18 mm long; pale green, with variable reddish-brown spots near head; head produced to a long prominent point; thorax with a raised dorsal ridge; abdomen slightly flattened, with three pairs of brown dorsal spots and a series of white lateral lines. The pupa is longer and narrower than that of other species of Elodina. ■ Larval food plants. Capparis canescens, C. mitchellii (Capparaceae). Larvae have been reported to feed on several species of Capparis (Waterhouse 1932b, 1937c; E.O. Edwards 1948; Manski 1960), but the only species documented in the literature are C. mitchellii (Waterhouse 1932b; Fisher 1978, 1984b) and C. canescens (De Baar and Flancock 1993a). ■ Life cycle and behaviour. Eggs are laid singly on the larval food plant, usually on a leaf or sometimes a stem (E.O. Edwards 1948; Fisher 1978, 1984b). The very inconspicuous larva feeds and rests along the edges of the leaves. Pupation occurs amongst the leaves and stems of the food plant, the pupa, also very inconspicuous, attached by the cremaster and a central silken girdle. When attached to a leaf the pupa is aligned along the central midrib of the leaf (Fisher 1984b) or attached to the underside (Waterhouse 1937c). Adults fly close to the ground, like those of E. parthia, but their flight is usually stronger. In flight they may be easily confused with Pieris rapae, although E. padusa tends to fly faster, more directly and less erratically. Adults occur during all months of the year in QLD, probably with several generations annually. The life cycle from egg to adult was completed in 33 days near Mitchell, QLD with the egg stage lasting six days (E.O. Edwards 1948). A life cycle of 29 days was reported when reared in captivity during March at Adelaide (Fisher 1984b). ■ Distribution and habitat. This species is endemic to Australia, where it is widespread over much of the mainland, except for the northern parts of the NT and Cape York Peninsula, the far south-east and in TAS and the south-western quarter of WA. In WA, it has been recorded as far south as Exmouth (Common and Waterhouse 1981), in NT as far north as Cullen River 28 km south-east of Pine Creek (C.E. Meyer), and in QLD as far north as Musgrave (Monteith and Hancock 1977). E. padusa is common in dry inland areas where the larval food plants grow (Waterhouse 1932b; Fisher 1978), and in SA it is relatively common in the Flinders Ranges. Although the species is not known to migrate, adults are clearly capable of dispersing great distances as they have been captured many hundreds of kilometres outside the natural range of the larval food plants. In the south-east, where it is a rare vagrant and breeding populations are not established, single specimens were collected from as far south as Jervis Bay in 1919 (L.M. Mosse-Robinson), nine kilometres east of Hoskinstown in 1980 (D.J. Ferguson), seven kilometres north-west of Bungendore in 1988 (J. Armstrong), NSW, suburban Canberra (Kitching et al. 1978), Mt Majura in 1993 (M.S. Roesler and A. Polak), Camels Back in the Tidbinbilla Range (1420 m) in 1998 (M.F. Braby), ACT, Dimboola, VIC (Waterhouse and Lyell 1914), and the Coorong in 1946, SA (Fisher 1978 and pers. comm.). Near Melbourne, it has been recorded very occasionally, with records from East St. Kilda, Wandin in 1914, Malvern in 1944 (Dunn and Dunn 1991), Croydon in 1944 (W.N.B. Quick) and Research in 1979 (T. Brain). Most specimens from these southern localities have been collected between October and January. A number of Victorian localities listed by Anderson and Spry (1893-94) for E. angulipennis, including Springvale, Balaclava, Coburg and Mt Buninyong near Ballarat during March and April, are probably erroneous. This species is not known to occur further south than Sydney, so these early records are likely to be of E. padusa. ■ Major reference. Fisher (1984b).",B_17014

Basically all Satyrinae can be divided into lowland and montane species. For example, the majority of Mycalesini are lowland species while most Lethini are high montane inhabitants. Many tropical species, as with species of temperate zones, prefer open areas, while many other species prefer shady undergrowth within forested habitats. A great number of Satyrinae species may be recorded in the tropical forest sub-canopy. Butterflies fly very close to the ground, often sitting either on the ground surface or on the leaves of herbs and shrubs. They often visit sunlit forest paths and trails. Many have a swift, short-lived flight when disturbed during the day and settle quickly with wings closed in near-by foliage. The majority of satyrids can be recorded in the vicinity of their foodplants which belong to monocotyledonous families such as Poaceae (grasses) and Arecaceae (palms). More information concerning habitats is in the relevant text for individual taxa. Such species as Melanitis leda, Elymnias hypermnestra, Ypthima baldus and some Mycalesis species can usually be found in secondary growth, countryside and urban gardens and parks.

Its flight is extremely fast, and the silver blotch on the underside of the hindwing flashes as the insect moves through dappled light and shade. It is difficult to follow in flight, but fortunately it is easily approached when feed ing at flowers, especially California buckeye (Aesculus califomica) and dogbanes (Apocynum), The Silver-spotted Skipper is found in riparian canyon habitat, often along roadsides where males perch on foliage well off the ground. In the Gold Country, and to a lesser extent in the North Coast Ranges, it has benefited from the introduction of the ornamental tree black locust (Robinia pseudacacia) in the nineteenth century. This is the usual host plant of the eastern subspecies (typical E. c. clarus)y and our sub species quickly adopted it as a host as weU. As a result, it is regu larly seen in towns such as Downieville, Jackson, or WeaverviUe, where no native hosts occur. Unlike the eastern subspecies, ours is seldom very common. DISTRIBUTION: North Bay counties, mainly inland. Formerly found with urban locust trees (Robinia) in Sacramento and Yolo Counties, but no recent records. HOST PLANTS: All pea family (Fabaceae) plants including false in digo or lead plant (Amorpha); Lotus crassifolius; black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) but apparendy not honey or moraine lo cust (Gleditsia triacanthos); perennial vetches (Lathyrus) sus pected. The rapidly spreading weedy riparian shrub Argentine flame pea (Sesbania punicea) is very likely to be adopted as a host plant in the next decade, potentially increasing the range and abundance of this species into the Sacramento Valley and Delta. Larvae tie several leaflets together to form solitary nests. The large larva has a brown head capsule with two bright orange eye like spots; many people find its appearance clownish. Since the larva rarely leaves its nest in daylight, the function of these spots is unknown. If disturbed, the larva throws fecal pellets through the air, adding to the comical effect. SEASONS: One brood. May to early July depending on locality. A very few late-summer records may indicate a rudimentary sec ond brood. The eastern subspecies is multiple brooded.

RANGE: Florida, Cuba and Bahamas. TL: Cuba. Early stages. The full-grown caterpillar is brilliant red, the body segments rather humped-up and each with a transverse row of four tubercles bearing tufts of short hair. In shape it is much less slug-like than usual for a Lycaenid caterpillar. It feeds openly on the leaves of the Cycad, Zamia integrifoliat 'Coontie' and is known as the Coontie Worm in Florida.

Zeitschr., 42, p.310 (1917) lasius Eecke, Zool. Med., 4, p.73 (1918) [Notes] This species belongs to the Agamemnon group of the subgenus Graphium. Besides the typical one the Macfarlanei and Wallacei subgroups are included in the Agamemnon group. The two are well-developed in the Papuan sub-region. This species is a widely distributed species ranging from S. India through the Archipelago eastwards to the Solomons, and is separated into 21 subspecies. Its sister species G. meeki on Santa Isabel Island is a exceedingly rare species, of only few females have so far been collected. On the contrary agamemnon is everywhere common, both the sexes being frequently collected. Within the area here dealt with ten subspecies are distributed, but these western agamemnon forms are not so attractive for they vary but little. Besides, the forms occurring in the vast area ranging from N. India through Sundaland to the Philippines and Formosa, are included in the nominate subspecies except those from the Andamans and a chain of islands off west coast of Sumatra. Futhermore, the subspecies from the latter islands also differ but little from the nominate subspecies. However, its eastern subspecies occurring from Papua to the Solomons vary dynamically, and several good subspecies are found among them, the example of which is the conspicuously darkened subspecies neopommeranius from the Bismarcks. Seven subspecies are figured in this book, other three, namely, decoratum of the Nicobars, lasius of Simeulue and atropictus of Engano being unavailable. The above three islands are all remotely located and difficult to enter. The butterflies visit various blossoms such as Lantana and Bougainvillea and frequently suck water. They fly off rapidly with their beautiful green markings glittering in thesun. They are found abundantly in submontane areas, but are equally found near seasides and villages. Rarely they are in evidence on the mountain, which suggest their strong flying powers. This species, with its wings spotted with bright green, was quite impressive when we first observed it in S. Formosa. It is not abundant in Formosa, but is widely distributed and very common from the Philippines to southwards. The female of this species are more frequently captured than the sex of other Graphium species, probably because this species is mainly collected on flowers. The female is larger than the male and has the longer tail though it varies in length within the same nominate subspecies. The female is paler, but it is more correctly identified by checking the scent hairs within the fold on the inner margin of the hindwing. The example figured in PLATE 148-5 is an aberrant form from W. Malaysia, such an aberration being rarely found in this species, though melanic forms are known to occur among other several species of Graphium such as sarpedon. The recorded larval food plants include Annona reticulata, A. squamosa and A. discolor (Annonaceae); Michelia fuscata, M. alba and M. figo (Magnoliaceae). The Graphium forms of Nias, for example, the subspecies of doson, evemon and sarpedon, have the beautifully developed red spots on the hindwing beneath in common, but rufoplenus, the Niasese subspecies of this species, has the only slightly enlarged red spots as compared with other subspecies, and lacks the brilliancy of the red spots unlike doson and evemon. In Nias it is found throughout the year but not so abundant. The Andaman subspecies andamanum is quite beautiful with its small green spots tinged with blue. The Celebesian comodus is differently looking in having the considerably large size and the darker ground colour. We obtained this species in some numbers from Lombok, where collecting should have been made in proper season. Ssp. exilis ranging from Timor to Tanimbar is difficult to obtain probably due to its scarcity. The subspecies, with its weakly spotted, dark hindwing, somewhat indicates the character of the Papuan subspecies. A typical tropical butterfly. Its soaring flight in the strong sunshine, as well as its swift flitting from flower to flower with the wing vibrated rapidly, is really impressive.

Vietnam (Tam Dao N.p.) HABITAT AND BIOLOGY. This species is common in gardens, parks and other open areas. Eggs are pale yellow and smooth and generally laid singly on the under surface of the leaves. In S.E. Asia the larval foodplants are trees as follows: Polyalthia longifolia,  Annona squamosa and A. reticulata (Annonaceae) and various Magnoliaceae: e.g. Michelia doltospa (d'Abrera, 1998). The population in the Malay Peninsula feeds on  Saccopetalum sp. and Friesodielsia sp. (Annonaceae) and Michelia spp.(Magnoliaceae).

Zeitschr., 42, p.310 (1917) lasius Eecke, Zool. Med., 4, p.73 (1918) [Notes] This species belongs to the Agamemnon group of the subgenus Graphium. Besides the typical one the Macfarlanei and Wallacei subgroups are included in the Agamemnon group. The two are well-developed in the Papuan sub-region. This species is a widely distributed species ranging from S. India through the Archipelago eastwards to the Solomons, and is separated into 21 subspecies. Its sister species G. meeki on Santa Isabel Island is a exceedingly rare species, of only few females have so far been collected. On the contrary agamemnon is everywhere common, both the sexes being frequently collected. Within the area here dealt with ten subspecies are distributed, but these western agamemnon forms are not so attractive for they vary but little. Besides, the forms occurring in the vast area ranging from N. India through Sundaland to the Philippines and Formosa, are included in the nominate subspecies except those from the Andamans and a chain of islands off west coast of Sumatra. Futhermore, the subspecies from the latter islands also differ but little from the nominate subspecies. However, its eastern subspecies occurring from Papua to the Solomons vary dynamically, and several good subspecies are found among them, the example of which is the conspicuously darkened subspecies neopommeranius from the Bismarcks. Seven subspecies are figured in this book, other three, namely, decoratum of the Nicobars, lasius of Simeulue and atropictus of Engano being unavailable. The above three islands are all remotely located and difficult to enter. The butterflies visit various blossoms such as Lantana and Bougainvillea and frequently suck water. They fly off rapidly with their beautiful green markings glittering in thesun. They are found abundantly in submontane areas, but are equally found near seasides and villages. Rarely they are in evidence on the mountain, which suggest their strong flying powers. This species, with its wings spotted with bright green, was quite impressive when we first observed it in S. Formosa. It is not abundant in Formosa, but is widely distributed and very common from the Philippines to southwards. The female of this species are more frequently captured than the sex of other Graphium species, probably because this species is mainly collected on flowers. The female is larger than the male and has the longer tail though it varies in length within the same nominate subspecies. The female is paler, but it is more correctly identified by checking the scent hairs within the fold on the inner margin of the hindwing. The example figured in PLATE 148-5 is an aberrant form from W. Malaysia, such an aberration being rarely found in this species, though melanic forms are known to occur among other several species of Graphium such as sarpedon. The recorded larval food plants include Annona reticulata, A. squamosa and A. discolor (Annonaceae); Michelia fuscata, M. alba and M. figo (Magnoliaceae). The Graphium forms of Nias, for example, the subspecies of doson, evemon and sarpedon, have the beautifully developed red spots on the hindwing beneath in common, but rufoplenus, the Niasese subspecies of this species, has the only slightly enlarged red spots as compared with other subspecies, and lacks the brilliancy of the red spots unlike doson and evemon. In Nias it is found throughout the year but not so abundant. The Andaman subspecies andamanum is quite beautiful with its small green spots tinged with blue. The Celebesian comodus is differently looking in having the considerably large size and the darker ground colour. We obtained this species in some numbers from Lombok, where collecting should have been made in proper season. Ssp. exilis ranging from Timor to Tanimbar is difficult to obtain probably due to its scarcity. The subspecies, with its weakly spotted, dark hindwing, somewhat indicates the character of the Papuan subspecies. A typical tropical butterfly. Its soaring flight in the strong sunshine, as well as its swift flitting from flower to flower with the wing vibrated rapidly, is really impressive.

Within the area here dealt with ten subspecies are distributed, but these western agamemnon forms are not so attractive for they vary but little. Besides, the forms occurring in the vast area ranging from N. India through Sundaland to the Philippines and Formosa, are included in the nominate subspecies except those from the Andamans and a chain of islands off west coast of Sumatra. Futhermore, the subspecies from the latter islands also differ but little from the nominate subspecies. However, its eastern subspecies occurring from Papua to the Solomons vary dynamically, and several good subspecies are found among them, the example of which is the conspicuously darkened subspecies neopommeranius from the Bismarcks. Seven subspecies are figured in this book, other three, namely, decoratum of the Nicobars, lasius of Simeulue and atropictus of Engano being unavailable. The above three islands are all remotely located and difficult to enter. The butterflies visit various blossoms such as Lantana and Bougainvillea and frequently suck water. They fly off rapidly with their beautiful green markings glittering in thesun. They are found abundantly in submontane areas, but are equally found near seasides and villages. Rarely they are in evidence on the mountain, which suggest their strong flying powers. This species, with its wings spotted with bright green, was quite impressive when we first observed it in S. Formosa. It is not abundant in Formosa, but is widely distributed and very common from the Philippines to southwards. The female of this species are more frequently captured than the sex of other Graphium species, probably because this species is mainly collected on flowers. The female is larger than the male and has the longer tail though it varies in length within the same nominate subspecies. The female is paler, but it is more correctly identified by checking the scent hairs within the fold on the inner margin of the hindwing. The example figured in PLATE 148-5 is an aberrant form from W. Malaysia, such an aberration being rarely found in this species, though melanic forms are known to occur among other several species of Graphium such as sarpedon. The recorded larval food plants include Annona reticulata, A. squamosa and A. discolor (Annonaceae); Michelia fuscata, M. alba and M. figo (Magnoliaceae). The Graphium forms of Nias, for example, the subspecies of doson, evemon and sarpedon, have the beautifully developed red spots on the hindwing beneath in common, but rufoplenus, the Niasese subspecies of this species, has the only slightly enlarged red spots as compared with other subspecies, and lacks the brilliancy of the red spots unlike doson and evemon. In Nias it is found throughout the year but not so abundant. The Andaman subspecies andamanum is quite beautiful with its small green spots tinged with blue. The Celebesian comodus is differently looking in having the considerably large size and the darker ground colour. We obtained this species in some numbers from Lombok, where collecting should have been made in proper season. Ssp. exilis ranging from Timor to Tanimbar is difficult to obtain probably due to its scarcity. The subspecies, with its weakly spotted, dark hindwing, somewhat indicates the character of the Papuan subspecies. A typical tropical butterfly. Its soaring flight in the strong sunshine, as well as its swift flitting from flower to flower with the wing vibrated rapidly, is really impressive.

Besides the typical one the Macfarlanei and Wallacei subgroups are included in the Agamemnon group. The two are well-developed in the Papuan sub-region. This species is a widely distributed species ranging from S. India through the Archipelago eastwards to the Solomons, and is separated into 21 subspecies. Its sister species G. meeki on Santa Isabel Island is a exceedingly rare species, of only few females have so far been collected. On the contrary agamemnon is everywhere common, both the sexes being frequently collected. Within the area here dealt with ten subspecies are distributed, but these western agamemnon forms are not so attractive for they vary but little. Besides, the forms occurring in the vast area ranging from N. India through Sundaland to the Philippines and Formosa, are included in the nominate subspecies except those from the Andamans and a chain of islands off west coast of Sumatra. Futhermore, the subspecies from the latter islands also differ but little from the nominate subspecies. However, its eastern subspecies occurring from Papua to the Solomons vary dynamically, and several good subspecies are found among them, the example of which is the conspicuously darkened subspecies neopommeranius from the Bismarcks. Seven subspecies are figured in this book, other three, namely, decoratum of the Nicobars, lasius of Simeulue and atropictus of Engano being unavailable. The above three islands are all remotely located and difficult to enter. The butterflies visit various blossoms such as Lantana and Bougainvillea and frequently suck water. They fly off rapidly with their beautiful green markings glittering in thesun. They are found abundantly in submontane areas, but are equally found near seasides and villages. Rarely they are in evidence on the mountain, which suggest their strong flying powers. This species, with its wings spotted with bright green, was quite impressive when we first observed it in S. Formosa. It is not abundant in Formosa, but is widely distributed and very common from the Philippines to southwards. The female of this species are more frequently captured than the sex of other Graphium species, probably because this species is mainly collected on flowers. The female is larger than the male and has the longer tail though it varies in length within the same nominate subspecies. The female is paler, but it is more correctly identified by checking the scent hairs within the fold on the inner margin of the hindwing. The example figured in PLATE 148-5 is an aberrant form from W. Malaysia, such an aberration being rarely found in this species, though melanic forms are known to occur among other several species of Graphium such as sarpedon. The recorded larval food plants include Annona reticulata, A. squamosa and A. discolor (Annonaceae); Michelia fuscata, M. alba and M. figo (Magnoliaceae). The Graphium forms of Nias, for example, the subspecies of doson, evemon and sarpedon, have the beautifully developed red spots on the hindwing beneath in common, but rufoplenus, the Niasese subspecies of this species, has the only slightly enlarged red spots as compared with other subspecies, and lacks the brilliancy of the red spots unlike doson and evemon. In Nias it is found throughout the year but not so abundant. The Andaman subspecies andamanum is quite beautiful with its small green spots tinged with blue. The Celebesian comodus is differently looking in having the considerably large size and the darker ground colour. We obtained this species in some numbers from Lombok, where collecting should have been made in proper season. Ssp. exilis ranging from Timor to Tanimbar is difficult to obtain probably due to its scarcity. The subspecies, with its weakly spotted, dark hindwing, somewhat indicates the character of the Papuan subspecies. A typical tropical butterfly. Its soaring flight in the strong sunshine, as well as its swift flitting from flower to flower with the wing vibrated rapidly, is really impressive.

Zeitschr., 42, p.310 (1917) lasius Eecke, Zool. Med., 4, p.73 (1918) [Notes] This species belongs to the Agamemnon group of the subgenus Graphium. Besides the typical one the Macfarlanei and Wallacei subgroups are included in the Agamemnon group. The two are well-developed in the Papuan sub-region. This species is a widely distributed species ranging from S. India through the Archipelago eastwards to the Solomons, and is separated into 21 subspecies. Its sister species G. meeki on Santa Isabel Island is a exceedingly rare species, of only few females have so far been collected. On the contrary agamemnon is everywhere common, both the sexes being frequently collected. Within the area here dealt with ten subspecies are distributed, but these western agamemnon forms are not so attractive for they vary but little. Besides, the forms occurring in the vast area ranging from N. India through Sundaland to the Philippines and Formosa, are included in the nominate subspecies except those from the Andamans and a chain of islands off west coast of Sumatra. Futhermore, the subspecies from the latter islands also differ but little from the nominate subspecies. However, its eastern subspecies occurring from Papua to the Solomons vary dynamically, and several good subspecies are found among them, the example of which is the conspicuously darkened subspecies neopommeranius from the Bismarcks. Seven subspecies are figured in this book, other three, namely, decoratum of the Nicobars, lasius of Simeulue and atropictus of Engano being unavailable. The above three islands are all remotely located and difficult to enter. The butterflies visit various blossoms such as Lantana and Bougainvillea and frequently suck water. They fly off rapidly with their beautiful green markings glittering in thesun. They are found abundantly in submontane areas, but are equally found near seasides and villages. Rarely they are in evidence on the mountain, which suggest their strong flying powers. This species, with its wings spotted with bright green, was quite impressive when we first observed it in S. Formosa. It is not abundant in Formosa, but is widely distributed and very common from the Philippines to southwards. The female of this species are more frequently captured than the sex of other Graphium species, probably because this species is mainly collected on flowers. The female is larger than the male and has the longer tail though it varies in length within the same nominate subspecies. The female is paler, but it is more correctly identified by checking the scent hairs within the fold on the inner margin of the hindwing. The example figured in PLATE 148-5 is an aberrant form from W. Malaysia, such an aberration being rarely found in this species, though melanic forms are known to occur among other several species of Graphium such as sarpedon. The recorded larval food plants include Annona reticulata, A. squamosa and A. discolor (Annonaceae); Michelia fuscata, M. alba and M. figo (Magnoliaceae). The Graphium forms of Nias, for example, the subspecies of doson, evemon and sarpedon, have the beautifully developed red spots on the hindwing beneath in common, but rufoplenus, the Niasese subspecies of this species, has the only slightly enlarged red spots as compared with other subspecies, and lacks the brilliancy of the red spots unlike doson and evemon. In Nias it is found throughout the year but not so abundant. The Andaman subspecies andamanum is quite beautiful with its small green spots tinged with blue. The Celebesian comodus is differently looking in having the considerably large size and the darker ground colour. We obtained this species in some numbers from Lombok, where collecting should have been made in proper season. Ssp. exilis ranging from Timor to Tanimbar is difficult to obtain probably due to its scarcity. The subspecies, with its weakly spotted, dark hindwing, somewhat indicates the character of the Papuan subspecies. A typical tropical butterfly. Its soaring flight in the strong sunshine, as well as its swift flitting from flower to flower with the wing vibrated rapidly, is really impressive.

The sexes are alike, but the female is slightly larger and has more prominent tails. Length of FW: [male] [female] 45-47 mm. TAXONOMIC NOTES. The long tail form menides Fruhstorfer, 1904 (TL: S. India) is distributed in Sri Lanka and s. India. Dubois & Vitalis de Salvaza (1921) showed the form menides from C. & S. Vietnam. The same long tail form has been also recorded in N. Vietnam (Tam Dao N.p.) HABITAT AND BIOLOGY. This species is common in gardens, parks and other open areas. Eggs are pale yellow and smooth and generally laid singly on the under surface of the leaves. In S.E. Asia the larval foodplants are trees as follows: Polyalthia longifolia,  Annona squamosa and A. reticulata (Annonaceae) and various Magnoliaceae: e.g. Michelia doltospa (d'Abrera, 1998). The population in the Malay Peninsula feeds on  Saccopetalum sp. and Friesodielsia sp. (Annonaceae) and Michelia spp.(Magnoliaceae). Chinese populations are known to feed on Magnolia grandiflora, Artabotrys uncinatus, Desmos cochinchinensis and Uvaria microcarpa. SIMILAR SPECIES.

Zeitschr., 42, p.310 (1917) lasius Eecke, Zool. Med., 4, p.73 (1918) [Notes] This species belongs to the Agamemnon group of the subgenus Graphium. Besides the typical one the Macfarlanei and Wallacei subgroups are included in the Agamemnon group. The two are well-developed in the Papuan sub-region. This species is a widely distributed species ranging from S. India through the Archipelago eastwards to the Solomons, and is separated into 21 subspecies. Its sister species G. meeki on Santa Isabel Island is a exceedingly rare species, of only few females have so far been collected. On the contrary agamemnon is everywhere common, both the sexes being frequently collected. Within the area here dealt with ten subspecies are distributed, but these western agamemnon forms are not so attractive for they vary but little. Besides, the forms occurring in the vast area ranging from N. India through Sundaland to the Philippines and Formosa, are included in the nominate subspecies except those from the Andamans and a chain of islands off west coast of Sumatra. Futhermore, the subspecies from the latter islands also differ but little from the nominate subspecies. However, its eastern subspecies occurring from Papua to the Solomons vary dynamically, and several good subspecies are found among them, the example of which is the conspicuously darkened subspecies neopommeranius from the Bismarcks. Seven subspecies are figured in this book, other three, namely, decoratum of the Nicobars, lasius of Simeulue and atropictus of Engano being unavailable. The above three islands are all remotely located and difficult to enter. The butterflies visit various blossoms such as Lantana and Bougainvillea and frequently suck water. They fly off rapidly with their beautiful green markings glittering in thesun. They are found abundantly in submontane areas, but are equally found near seasides and villages. Rarely they are in evidence on the mountain, which suggest their strong flying powers. This species, with its wings spotted with bright green, was quite impressive when we first observed it in S. Formosa. It is not abundant in Formosa, but is widely distributed and very common from the Philippines to southwards. The female of this species are more frequently captured than the sex of other Graphium species, probably because this species is mainly collected on flowers. The female is larger than the male and has the longer tail though it varies in length within the same nominate subspecies. The female is paler, but it is more correctly identified by checking the scent hairs within the fold on the inner margin of the hindwing. The example figured in PLATE 148-5 is an aberrant form from W. Malaysia, such an aberration being rarely found in this species, though melanic forms are known to occur among other several species of Graphium such as sarpedon. The recorded larval food plants include Annona reticulata, A. squamosa and A. discolor (Annonaceae); Michelia fuscata, M. alba and M. figo (Magnoliaceae). The Graphium forms of Nias, for example, the subspecies of doson, evemon and sarpedon, have the beautifully developed red spots on the hindwing beneath in common, but rufoplenus, the Niasese subspecies of this species, has the only slightly enlarged red spots as compared with other subspecies, and lacks the brilliancy of the red spots unlike doson and evemon. In Nias it is found throughout the year but not so abundant. The Andaman subspecies andamanum is quite beautiful with its small green spots tinged with blue. The Celebesian comodus is differently looking in having the considerably large size and the darker ground colour. We obtained this species in some numbers from Lombok, where collecting should have been made in proper season. Ssp. exilis ranging from Timor to Tanimbar is difficult to obtain probably due to its scarcity. The subspecies, with its weakly spotted, dark hindwing, somewhat indicates the character of the Papuan subspecies. A typical tropical butterfly. Its soaring flight in the strong sunshine, as well as its swift flitting from flower to flower with the wing vibrated rapidly, is really impressive.

Rarely they are in evidence on the mountain, which suggest their strong flying powers. This species, with its wings spotted with bright green, was quite impressive when we first observed it in S. Formosa. It is not abundant in Formosa, but is widely distributed and very common from the Philippines to southwards. The female of this species are more frequently captured than the sex of other Graphium species, probably because this species is mainly collected on flowers. The female is larger than the male and has the longer tail though it varies in length within the same nominate subspecies. The female is paler, but it is more correctly identified by checking the scent hairs within the fold on the inner margin of the hindwing. The example figured in PLATE 148-5 is an aberrant form from W. Malaysia, such an aberration being rarely found in this species, though melanic forms are known to occur among other several species of Graphium such as sarpedon. The recorded larval food plants include Annona reticulata, A. squamosa and A. discolor (Annonaceae); Michelia fuscata, M. alba and M. figo (Magnoliaceae). The Graphium forms of Nias, for example, the subspecies of doson, evemon and sarpedon, have the beautifully developed red spots on the hindwing beneath in common, but rufoplenus, the Niasese subspecies of this species, has the only slightly enlarged red spots as compared with other subspecies, and lacks the brilliancy of the red spots unlike doson and evemon. In Nias it is found throughout the year but not so abundant. The Andaman subspecies andamanum is quite beautiful with its small green spots tinged with blue. The Celebesian comodus is differently looking in having the considerably large size and the darker ground colour. We obtained this species in some numbers from Lombok, where collecting should have been made in proper season. Ssp. exilis ranging from Timor to Tanimbar is difficult to obtain probably due to its scarcity. The subspecies, with its weakly spotted, dark hindwing, somewhat indicates the character of the Papuan subspecies. A typical tropical butterfly. Its soaring flight in the strong sunshine, as well as its swift flitting from flower to flower with the wing vibrated rapidly, is really impressive.

Besides the typical one the Macfarlanei and Wallacei subgroups are included in the Agamemnon group. The two are well-developed in the Papuan sub-region. This species is a widely distributed species ranging from S. India through the Archipelago eastwards to the Solomons, and is separated into 21 subspecies. Its sister species G. meeki on Santa Isabel Island is a exceedingly rare species, of only few females have so far been collected. On the contrary agamemnon is everywhere common, both the sexes being frequently collected. Within the area here dealt with ten subspecies are distributed, but these western agamemnon forms are not so attractive for they vary but little. Besides, the forms occurring in the vast area ranging from N. India through Sundaland to the Philippines and Formosa, are included in the nominate subspecies except those from the Andamans and a chain of islands off west coast of Sumatra. Futhermore, the subspecies from the latter islands also differ but little from the nominate subspecies. However, its eastern subspecies occurring from Papua to the Solomons vary dynamically, and several good subspecies are found among them, the example of which is the conspicuously darkened subspecies neopommeranius from the Bismarcks. Seven subspecies are figured in this book, other three, namely, decoratum of the Nicobars, lasius of Simeulue and atropictus of Engano being unavailable.

Zeitschr., 42, p.310 (1917) lasius Eecke, Zool. Med., 4, p.73 (1918) [Notes] This species belongs to the Agamemnon group of the subgenus Graphium. Besides the typical one the Macfarlanei and Wallacei subgroups are included in the Agamemnon group. The two are well-developed in the Papuan sub-region. This species is a widely distributed species ranging from S. India through the Archipelago eastwards to the Solomons, and is separated into 21 subspecies. Its sister species G. meeki on Santa Isabel Island is a exceedingly rare species, of only few females have so far been collected. On the contrary agamemnon is everywhere common, both the sexes being frequently collected. Within the area here dealt with ten subspecies are distributed, but these western agamemnon forms are not so attractive for they vary but little. Besides, the forms occurring in the vast area ranging from N. India through Sundaland to the Philippines and Formosa, are included in the nominate subspecies except those from the Andamans and a chain of islands off west coast of Sumatra. Futhermore, the subspecies from the latter islands also differ but little from the nominate subspecies. However, its eastern subspecies occurring from Papua to the Solomons vary dynamically, and several good subspecies are found among them, the example of which is the conspicuously darkened subspecies neopommeranius from the Bismarcks. Seven subspecies are figured in this book, other three, namely, decoratum of the Nicobars, lasius of Simeulue and atropictus of Engano being unavailable. The above three islands are all remotely located and difficult to enter. The butterflies visit various blossoms such as Lantana and Bougainvillea and frequently suck water. They fly off rapidly with their beautiful green markings glittering in thesun. They are found abundantly in submontane areas, but are equally found near seasides and villages. Rarely they are in evidence on the mountain, which suggest their strong flying powers. This species, with its wings spotted with bright green, was quite impressive when we first observed it in S. Formosa. It is not abundant in Formosa, but is widely distributed and very common from the Philippines to southwards. The female of this species are more frequently captured than the sex of other Graphium species, probably because this species is mainly collected on flowers. The female is larger than the male and has the longer tail though it varies in length within the same nominate subspecies. The female is paler, but it is more correctly identified by checking the scent hairs within the fold on the inner margin of the hindwing. The example figured in PLATE 148-5 is an aberrant form from W. Malaysia, such an aberration being rarely found in this species, though melanic forms are known to occur among other several species of Graphium such as sarpedon. The recorded larval food plants include Annona reticulata, A. squamosa and A. discolor (Annonaceae); Michelia fuscata, M. alba and M. figo (Magnoliaceae). The Graphium forms of Nias, for example, the subspecies of doson, evemon and sarpedon, have the beautifully developed red spots on the hindwing beneath in common, but rufoplenus, the Niasese subspecies of this species, has the only slightly enlarged red spots as compared with other subspecies, and lacks the brilliancy of the red spots unlike doson and evemon. In Nias it is found throughout the year but not so abundant. The Andaman subspecies andamanum is quite beautiful with its small green spots tinged with blue. The Celebesian comodus is differently looking in having the considerably large size and the darker ground colour. We obtained this species in some numbers from Lombok, where collecting should have been made in proper season. Ssp. exilis ranging from Timor to Tanimbar is difficult to obtain probably due to its scarcity. The subspecies, with its weakly spotted, dark hindwing, somewhat indicates the character of the Papuan subspecies. A typical tropical butterfly. Its soaring flight in the strong sunshine, as well as its swift flitting from flower to flower with the wing vibrated rapidly, is really impressive.

Moluccas is often considered as a subspecies of glaucippe. But, here, I separate them because they are constantly different in appearance and in male and female genitalia. I.e. in leucippe, 1) forewing entirely yellow, 2) distal process of valva not fairly long; harpal process from the inner valva ill-developed and 3) cervix bursae of the female genitalia much longer than glaucippe. Characters: Glaucippe has 1) wing above usually white, 2) orange markings not extend toward the base, 3) male genitalia harpal process well-developed and 4) cervix bursae shorter than leucippe. Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens. Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail. Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

Mus., 18, p. 383~4 (1939) Aur  [Notes] Large sized butterflies distributed throughout the Oriental Region and N. Moluccas. In Japan they are found in Southern Kyushu and Yaeyama Is. Leucippe from S. Moluccas is often considered as a subspecies of glaucippe. But, here, I separate them because they are constantly different in appearance and in male and female genitalia. I.e. in leucippe, 1) forewing entirely yellow, 2) distal process of valva not fairly long; harpal process from the inner valva ill-developed and 3) cervix bursae of the female genitalia much longer than glaucippe. Characters: Glaucippe has 1) wing above usually white, 2) orange markings not extend toward the base, 3) male genitalia harpal process well-developed and 4) cervix bursae shorter than leucippe. Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens. Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail. Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

Mus., 18, p. 383~4 (1939) Aur  [Notes] Large sized butterflies distributed throughout the Oriental Region and N. Moluccas. In Japan they are found in Southern Kyushu and Yaeyama Is. Leucippe from S. Moluccas is often considered as a subspecies of glaucippe. But, here, I separate them because they are constantly different in appearance and in male and female genitalia. I.e. in leucippe, 1) forewing entirely yellow, 2) distal process of valva not fairly long; harpal process from the inner valva ill-developed and 3) cervix bursae of the female genitalia much longer than glaucippe. Characters: Glaucippe has 1) wing above usually white, 2) orange markings not extend toward the base, 3) male genitalia harpal process well-developed and 4) cervix bursae shorter than leucippe. Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens. Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail. Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

Moluccas is often considered as a subspecies of glaucippe. But, here, I separate them because they are constantly different in appearance and in male and female genitalia. I.e. in leucippe, 1) forewing entirely yellow, 2) distal process of valva not fairly long; harpal process from the inner valva ill-developed and 3) cervix bursae of the female genitalia much longer than glaucippe. Characters: Glaucippe has 1) wing above usually white, 2) orange markings not extend toward the base, 3) male genitalia harpal process well-developed and 4) cervix bursae shorter than leucippe. Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens. Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail. Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

Mus., 18, p. 383~4 (1939) Aur  [Notes] Large sized butterflies distributed throughout the Oriental Region and N. Moluccas. In Japan they are found in Southern Kyushu and Yaeyama Is. Leucippe from S. Moluccas is often considered as a subspecies of glaucippe. But, here, I separate them because they are constantly different in appearance and in male and female genitalia. I.e. in leucippe, 1) forewing entirely yellow, 2) distal process of valva not fairly long; harpal process from the inner valva ill-developed and 3) cervix bursae of the female genitalia much longer than glaucippe. Characters: Glaucippe has 1) wing above usually white, 2) orange markings not extend toward the base, 3) male genitalia harpal process well-developed and 4) cervix bursae shorter than leucippe. Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens. Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail. Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

Mus., 18, p. 383~4 (1939) Aur  [Notes] Large sized butterflies distributed throughout the Oriental Region and N. Moluccas. In Japan they are found in Southern Kyushu and Yaeyama Is. Leucippe from S. Moluccas is often considered as a subspecies of glaucippe. But, here, I separate them because they are constantly different in appearance and in male and female genitalia. I.e. in leucippe, 1) forewing entirely yellow, 2) distal process of valva not fairly long; harpal process from the inner valva ill-developed and 3) cervix bursae of the female genitalia much longer than glaucippe. Characters: Glaucippe has 1) wing above usually white, 2) orange markings not extend toward the base, 3) male genitalia harpal process well-developed and 4) cervix bursae shorter than leucippe. Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens. Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail. Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

Mus., 18, p. 383~4 (1939) Aur  [Notes] Large sized butterflies distributed throughout the Oriental Region and N. Moluccas. In Japan they are found in Southern Kyushu and Yaeyama Is. Leucippe from S. Moluccas is often considered as a subspecies of glaucippe. But, here, I separate them because they are constantly different in appearance and in male and female genitalia. I.e. in leucippe, 1) forewing entirely yellow, 2) distal process of valva not fairly long; harpal process from the inner valva ill-developed and 3) cervix bursae of the female genitalia much longer than glaucippe. Characters: Glaucippe has 1) wing above usually white, 2) orange markings not extend toward the base, 3) male genitalia harpal process well-developed and 4) cervix bursae shorter than leucippe. Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens. Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail. Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

Moluccas is often considered as a subspecies of glaucippe. But, here, I separate them because they are constantly different in appearance and in male and female genitalia. I.e. in leucippe, 1) forewing entirely yellow, 2) distal process of valva not fairly long; harpal process from the inner valva ill-developed and 3) cervix bursae of the female genitalia much longer than glaucippe. Characters: Glaucippe has 1) wing above usually white, 2) orange markings not extend toward the base, 3) male genitalia harpal process well-developed and 4) cervix bursae shorter than leucippe. Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens.

Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

Moluccas is often considered as a subspecies of glaucippe. But, here, I separate them because they are constantly different in appearance and in male and female genitalia. I.e. in leucippe, 1) forewing entirely yellow, 2) distal process of valva not fairly long; harpal process from the inner valva ill-developed and 3) cervix bursae of the female genitalia much longer than glaucippe. Characters: Glaucippe has 1) wing above usually white, 2) orange markings not extend toward the base, 3) male genitalia harpal process well-developed and 4) cervix bursae shorter than leucippe. Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced.

Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail. Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

Moluccas is often considered as a subspecies of glaucippe. But, here, I separate them because they are constantly different in appearance and in male and female genitalia. I.e. in leucippe, 1) forewing entirely yellow, 2) distal process of valva not fairly long; harpal process from the inner valva ill-developed and 3) cervix bursae of the female genitalia much longer than glaucippe. Characters: Glaucippe has 1) wing above usually white, 2) orange markings not extend toward the base, 3) male genitalia harpal process well-developed and 4) cervix bursae shorter than leucippe. Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens. Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail.

The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus.

Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens. Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail. Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens. Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail. Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

Moluccas is often considered as a subspecies of glaucippe. But, here, I separate them because they are constantly different in appearance and in male and female genitalia. I.e. in leucippe, 1) forewing entirely yellow, 2) distal process of valva not fairly long; harpal process from the inner valva ill-developed and 3) cervix bursae of the female genitalia much longer than glaucippe. Characters: Glaucippe has 1) wing above usually white, 2) orange markings not extend toward the base, 3) male genitalia harpal process well-developed and 4) cervix bursae shorter than leucippe. Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens. Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail. Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus.

Moluccas is often considered as a subspecies of glaucippe. But, here, I separate them because they are constantly different in appearance and in male and female genitalia. I.e. in leucippe, 1) forewing entirely yellow, 2) distal process of valva not fairly long; harpal process from the inner valva ill-developed and 3) cervix bursae of the female genitalia much longer than glaucippe. Characters: Glaucippe has 1) wing above usually white, 2) orange markings not extend toward the base, 3) male genitalia harpal process well-developed and 4) cervix bursae shorter than leucippe. Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens. Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail. Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

Moluccas is often considered as a subspecies of glaucippe. But, here, I separate them because they are constantly different in appearance and in male and female genitalia. I.e. in leucippe, 1) forewing entirely yellow, 2) distal process of valva not fairly long; harpal process from the inner valva ill-developed and 3) cervix bursae of the female genitalia much longer than glaucippe. Characters: Glaucippe has 1) wing above usually white, 2) orange markings not extend toward the base, 3) male genitalia harpal process well-developed and 4) cervix bursae shorter than leucippe. Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens. Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail. Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

Moluccas is often considered as a subspecies of glaucippe. But, here, I separate them because they are constantly different in appearance and in male and female genitalia. I.e. in leucippe, 1) forewing entirely yellow, 2) distal process of valva not fairly long; harpal process from the inner valva ill-developed and 3) cervix bursae of the female genitalia much longer than glaucippe. Characters: Glaucippe has 1) wing above usually white, 2) orange markings not extend toward the base, 3) male genitalia harpal process well-developed and 4) cervix bursae shorter than leucippe. Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens. Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail. Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

Moluccas is often considered as a subspecies of glaucippe. But, here, I separate them because they are constantly different in appearance and in male and female genitalia. I.e. in leucippe, 1) forewing entirely yellow, 2) distal process of valva not fairly long; harpal process from the inner valva ill-developed and 3) cervix bursae of the female genitalia much longer than glaucippe. Characters: Glaucippe has 1) wing above usually white, 2) orange markings not extend toward the base, 3) male genitalia harpal process well-developed and 4) cervix bursae shorter than leucippe. Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens. Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail. Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

Moluccas is often considered as a subspecies of glaucippe. But, here, I separate them because they are constantly different in appearance and in male and female genitalia. I.e. in leucippe, 1) forewing entirely yellow, 2) distal process of valva not fairly long; harpal process from the inner valva ill-developed and 3) cervix bursae of the female genitalia much longer than glaucippe. Characters: Glaucippe has 1) wing above usually white, 2) orange markings not extend toward the base, 3) male genitalia harpal process well-developed and 4) cervix bursae shorter than leucippe. Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens. Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail. Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

Moluccas is often considered as a subspecies of glaucippe. But, here, I separate them because they are constantly different in appearance and in male and female genitalia. I.e. in leucippe, 1) forewing entirely yellow, 2) distal process of valva not fairly long; harpal process from the inner valva ill-developed and 3) cervix bursae of the female genitalia much longer than glaucippe. Characters: Glaucippe has 1) wing above usually white, 2) orange markings not extend toward the base, 3) male genitalia harpal process well-developed and 4) cervix bursae shorter than leucippe. Varieties: Seasonal forms in the high latitudes are slightly different. Spring (dry-season) form is smaller than summer (wetseason) form, and has the forewing apex curved and strongly acute. Island forms are very variable. Ryukyu Island (Kurosawa & Omoto, 1955) and Oriental (Morishita, 1973) forms are revised. Morishita (1973) recognized following seven subspecies group: 1) India. Malay Peninsula, 2) Andamans-Paramalaya, 3) Ryukyu, 4) Lesser Sundas, 5) Celebes, 6) Philippines and 7) N. Moluccas. In Andaman-Paramalayan subspecies-group, wing above is yellow. Niasan vossi has the wings in both sexes entirely bright yellow. Roepstorffi from Andamans has outer half of wing yellown. In Indo-Malayan subspecies-group, male wing is white. while female is pale yellowish-green with well developed marginal and submarginal black markings. Bornean borneensis has the black oblique band just below the orange markings conspicuously broad. Oran'ge markings in the female are covered by black scales. In Lesser Sundanian subspeciesgroup. butterflies are smaller. Male above ground color tinged with yellow and the orange markings are larger. Javanese javaensis is small-sized. Inner ridge of the orange markings and hindwing costa in the male are more or less covered with yellow. Flavomarginata from Sumba and Sumbawa has black markings obsolete. In Celebesian subspecies-group. butterflies are largesized with strongly acute apex. Orange markings extend into the cell. Celebesian celebensis has wing ground color white with well-developed orange markings. In Philippine subspecies-group. butterflies are smaller. Black edge under the orange markings is vestigial or entirely absent. Male above with some yellow. Female is entirely covered with pale-yellow. In iliaca from Mindanao. black marking is declining, and apex less pointed than N.C. Philippine form. The form from Palawan has the black marking much more reduced. Some abnormal forms have hitherto been described. In ab. dorolheae, black markings in the male become off-white. Male orange markings become bright-yellow in ab. pallens. Early stages: Well known for a long time. Piepers & Snellen (1909) Uava], Bell (1912-14) [India], Ng (1935) [China] and Shir6zu & Hara (1960) [Japan] have described them in detail. Egg; 1.6mm high by 1.0mm wide; color creamy-white or yellow-white when laid, turning orange later; shape of a dumpy shell; 11-14 ridges; no lateral stripe. The egg is laid, always singly, on the sprout or stalk of food plant. Final instar larva; 47-55mm long by 8mm wide; color glaucous-green with white spiracular line; surface covered with transparent, conical, bluish tubercles, each bearing a fine, short seta; this marking suggests a snake when the larva leans backward by stimulus. The larva lies along the midrib of leaf surface with a good carpet of white silk, with its head toward the point. And it moves to the edge of leaf to eat. Pupa; 35-40mm long; shape of Catopsilia and Gonepteryx; dorsal line nearly straight; wing sheath strongly expanded; cephalic snout short and thick, not pointed at the tip; color green or yellow. Larval food plants belong to the Capparidaceae and the larva has been found on Crataeva religiosa in India. Capparis moonii [India], C. pumila [Hong Kong] and C. formosana (?) are also reported. They have also Rorippa indica under the breeding condition, but the adults are smaller than wiled butterflies. Bionomics: Butterflies are quick and stout in flight. They fly so far from the ground and often visit certain flowers. Males delight in sunny place and visit moist spot, while females are found in the forest where the food plants grow. When at rest on the ground the insect is almost invisible, the reverse side pattern blending so well with the surroundings. The species are commonly found in the tropical monsoon zone such as Formosa, Indo-China Peninsula and India, while they are not so common in the island as in Sundalands. They brood four times a year in Kyushu and may hibernate in pupa or non-diapause larva (Fukuda et aI., 1972). Diapause larva occurs in Kagoshima and the critical day light is 12hr. and a half in 20°C. Diapause and non-diapause larva are indistinctive.

It has since re-expanded a little in the late 1980s and 1990s, mainly in south-east England.; There are currently eight main centres of distribution: north Dorset, south Wiltshire, east and west Hampshire, Surrey, east Sussex, east Kent, and the southern part of the Chilterns.; The range...appears to be stable in many European countries but has declined seriously in Belgium, Latvia, and Luxembourg (>50% decrease in 25 years), and also in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Sweden (25-50% decline in 25 years).; Resident, decline and recent partial re-expansion of its range.; Across Europe from central Spain to Scandinavia and throughout temperate Asia.

Butterfly Conservation priority: high. European status: not threatened. Protected in Great Britain for sale only.; declined rapidly over the last 50 years but has re-expanded partially since 1980.; adults tend to concentrate on suitable breeding habitat… large areas of habitat are more likely to be colonized than small ones and the rate of colonization tails off rapidly with distance. Small populations have also been shown to have particularly high emigration and often immigration rates and cannot be regarded as self-sustaining colonies. The butterfly is thus thought to form metapopulations covering relatively large areas of countryside within which it breeds in numerous discrete habitat patches. Some of these are larger and more permanently occupied core sites while other are occupied more temporarily.; An intensive national survey of the species, conducted in 1982, found that it had been reduced to 49 more or less distinct sites. Over half of these contained very small colonies 3500 at peak. A subsequent survey of the North and South Downs in 1991 found that the number of occupied habitat patches in this region of south-east England had increased by about 30%. The data for 1995-9 show that the butterfly has continued to expand and has been recorded in 48% more 10 km grid squares than in 1970-82. However, sites further than about 10 km from any refuge sites have not been colonized and the butterfly is still absent from much of its former distribution.; The introduction of myxomatosis in the early 1950s severely reduced rabbit populations and led to a sudden decline of the butterfly, which reached a low point in the 1970s.; The re-expansion has been accompanied by, and probably assisted by, a steady increase in population sizes on many extant sites over the last 20 years.","...seen darting low over short turf, stopping frequently to bask on bare ground","The butterfly breeds in open chalk grassland which contains patches of short, sparse turf typically on thin soils. It also occurred formerly on limestone grassland in central and northern England. Warm, south facing slopes are prefered, but a few colonies occur on slopes with other aspects, including some gently north-facing ones.; The Silver-spotted Skipper is a rare butterfly, found only on chalk downland in southern England.; This rare skipper is restricted to chalk downs in southern England.; requires some of the hottest and driest grasslands available [in Britain], laying its eggs on foodplants growing in the warmest positions. This restricts it to the warmer climate of southern England and to shorter swards where it usually relies on grazing by livestock or rabbits.","Eggs are laid singly on leaf blades of Sheep's-fescue or occasionally on adjacent plants, where they pass the winter. Females are highly selective a lay most of their eggs on small tufts of foodplant growing in short turf (1-4cm tall) and often next to small patches of bare ground. Most eggs are laid next to animal tracks, old rabbit scrapes, or where there is some erosion on steep slopes or due to grazing animals.

Since 1980, it has colonized several new sites within 1km of existing populations, and occasionally sites up to 8.5km away. However, large areas of habitat are more likely to be colonized than small ones and the rate of colonization tails off rapidly with distance. Small populations have also been shown to have particularly high emigration and often immigration rates and cannot be regarded as self-sustaining colonies. The butterfly is thus thought to form metapopulations covering relatively large areas of countryside within which it breeds in numerous discrete habitat patches. Some of these are larger and more permanently occupied core sites while other are occupied more temporarily.; The data for 1995-9 show that the butterfly has continued to expand and has been recorded in 48% more 10 km grid squares than in 1970-82. However, sites further than about 10 km from any refuge sites have not been colonized and the butterfly is still absent from much of its former distribution.",NA,No,,vaughn.shirey,Ries Lab,08/01/2018 - 10:12,08/30/2018 - 11:05,,"Silver-spotted Skipper Hi'sfn'ria comma Silver-spotted Skipper 1995-9 1 sighting • 2-9 max seen % 10+max seen (31 squares) : 1970-82 pre-1970 :: V r- .

Chocolate-brown, long DFW crossed by brassy-gold patches, bluntly tailed VHW with large, jagged, bright silver marks across their discs. No other Northwest skipper approaches its size or dramatic markings. Variation  E. c. ""clarus"" (TI, Dayton, VA), occupies the eastern section of the territory. These are actually smaller, with reduced spots and a darker ventrum than true eastern E. c. clarus, and may represent an unnamed subspecies. In and west of the Cascades flies E. c. californicus MacNeil, 1975 (TI. China Flat. El Dorado Co., CA), which has the upper half of the silver spot narrowed, and the posterior portion of the golden spot on the DFW reduced and nearly separated from the band. Life History The red-capped, ribbed green eggs are laid singly atop leaves of many kinds of legumes, including ornamental locusts (Robinia spp.) and wisteria. Pelham has reared E. c. californicus on Lotus crassifolius, the only host known for the ssp. here. A favorite hostplant for E. c. clarus in the West is wild licorice (Glycyrrhiza lepidota), a common riparian shrub in the eastern Columbia Gorge. Black locust trees introduced by pioneers are also used in the dry side. The greenish larvae have red and yellow legs, and black bands and shiny head. When small they fold a leaf into a tent, when larger, two leaves bound by silk. Dark brown chrysalides overwinter. A single generation. On the Wing E. April - L. August, peak in June. Habitat and Range Watercourses, parks, gardens, afforesting cuts, heath-like Christmas tree farms, and other open, flowery places at lower to middle elevations. Most of the U.S. and southern Canada; irregular in the West, omitting the Great Basin. Much of the east side of Cascadia, far less common on the west side: barely in SW coastal BC and S Vancouver Is,; Puget Trough in WA, more abundant southward in Coast Range of OR. Our largest skipper, this is also the most dramatically colored. From the glassy golden spots on the forewings and the big silver patches on the ventral hindwings, its rapid, herky-jerky flight alloys a brilliant metallic streak. In Great Britain, the name Silver-spotted Skipper applies to what we call the Common Branded Skipper [Hesperia comma)-, ours has the greater claim, with much larger silver spots. In boyhood. I pretended that these common neighborhood habitues of honeysuckle bushes were giant skippers of the desert Southwest. Unlike the yucca- and agave-burrowing megathymines. which do not make it north to Cascadia, f. clarus is a generalist on many legumes. Even so, the species is far more restricted on the westside than is the population east of the Cascades, For example, it occurs regularly among Lotus crassifolius stands in unsprayed Christmas tree plantations above Hood Canal, but unpredictably elsewhere in western Washington. Silver-spotted Skippers like hot and sunny country as well as moisture, so they become more common in eastern and southwestern Cascadia, In Benton County. Oregon, Andy Warren observed males perching from late morning through early afternoon, alert for interloping males and passing females. The perches ranged from twelve to fifteen feet above the ground. In July. 1999. I found a live, egg-heavy female trapped in the hot sunny foyer of a grocery store in Old Town, Idaho, fifty yards east of the Washington state line. I released her across the street, on sweet clover in Newport. Washington, The next day, T. L, Pyle found one just below the Canadian border along the Columbia, a little way into Stevens County. So, although Rend Orelile County was bracketed by Silver-spotted Skippers, it remained without a record of its own.",B_1193

It is not known whether it is native to Califor nia or was introduced from the tropics or subtropics. It may not have been in our area before the 1930s. Specimens collected in cool weather tend to have heavier spot-patterns beneath, and the female ground color beneath is sootier. Otherwise, there is little variation. DISTRIBUTION: All counties, almost never in wildlands. HOST PLANTS: Mostly Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon), occa sionally on other lawn grasses such as Dallis grass (Paspalum); its native host may be alkali grass (Distichlis spicata), which occurs naturally nearly throughout its hemispheric range. SEASONS: Records exist for all months, but mostly March to early December; rarely common before July. SIMILAR SPECIES: The Fiery Skipper has a sharply pointed forewing and short antennae; the ventral hindwing pattern has dis crete spots not forming connected bands; the stigma is slender, the gray in center scarcely noticeable; the male has triangular dark spots along the margins. This set of traits should distinguish the Fiery Skipper from all the other similarly colored skippers. ",B_1223

One of these species, and 2 others from elsewhere, are insular taxa, being restricted to small islands. Only 1 of the NG species, I. juventa, occurs in PNG and it enjoys the largest distribution of the 8 species. I. hewitsonii Kirsch, 1877, is restricted to Biak Island in Geelvink Bay, Irian Jaya, and the Moluccan /. vitrea (Blanchard, 1853) occurs only as far eastwards as the Arfak and Wandammen Mountains of Irian Jaya. Ideopsis ranges from Sri Lanka (as an isolated portion of the distribution of /. similis (Linnaeus, 1758)), throughout South-east Asia, as far northwards as southernmost Japan, and throughout the Indonesian archipelago, to NG, the Bismarcks and Solomons. However, the genus does not reach Australia. The type species for Ideopsis is gaura (Horsfield, 1829), designated by Scudder, 1875. Ackery and Vane-Wright listed the following synonyms of Ideopsis: Radena Moore, 1880; Gamana Moore, 1883; Aianthis Fruhstorfer, 1910. Ideopsis exhibits little sexual dimorphism. However, all of the males possess a characteristic, but somewhat indistinct, dark, linear sex-brand on the hindwing which borders the entire length of vein 1A+2A. Neither this vein, nor adjacent veins, are swollen as they are in Parantica. Veins and Sc of the forewing are anastomosed but separate before they meet the costal margin. However, Ackery and Vane-Wright pointed out that this feature also occurs in some Parantica, Euploea and other danaine genera. They noted that the inner lamina of the male valva is folded and produced into a downwardly directed, pointed process. As in Parantica (and some other members of the Danainae) the corpus bursae of the female is double-chambered. Vane-Wright and Boppre (1990) stated that, amongst the 6 currently recognised genera of the Danaini, only Ideopsis is known not to include species which produce pheromone transfer particles (see Tribe Danaini). Some members of Ideopsis were included in Danaus by Talbot (1943b). Ackery and Vane-Wright found that there was a paucity of good characters by which Ideopsis species could be recognised, but that the division of the genus into 2 equal groups {Radena and Ideopsis) was warranted. They suggested that many aspects of the biology of all Ideopsis species will have to be studied before a meaningful classification of the genus can be made. In their habits, Ideopsis are generally similar to Parantica. Members of the genus frequent marginal forest and small open areas of low-growing shrubs, but Ideopsis is less distinctly montane than Parantica, most of its species ranging up to about an elevation of about 1,000 m. However, I. klassika Martin, 1909, endemic to the island of Seram in the Moluccas, is known to occur as high as 2,500 m (Rothschild, 1915b; as stresemanni).",B_10629

Habitat: Coastal and secondary forest and savanna.  Also in Brachystegia woodland (Heath et al., 2002).  In Tanzania at altitudes from 900 to 2 000 m (Kielland, 1990d). Habits: Males hilltop from midday onwards, choosing the highest leaves and twigs of trees as perches.  Females are most often encountered around bunches of loranthus, the larval host-plants (Pringle et al., 1994). Flight period: All year. Early stages: Jackson, 1937: 215  [as Epamera sidus; Mount Elgon, Kenya]. “The larvae feed on the leaves or young flower-buds (of Loranthus woodfordioides), but not ‘as a rule’ on the flowers after they have opened.”  “Egg.  The eggs are laid on the upper- or undersides of the leaves, on the buds, stems, etc., without any apparent effort at concealment.  They are yellow, circular and domed, with a complicated embossed pattern covering the surface.  Diameter, about 0.5 mm.  Larva.  The larva is very strangely formed.  Green or greyish-green with a large whitish triangular spot filling up the central depression.  Beginning at the anal extremity and arising from the last four segments there is a large tent-like process ending in in a curved and sharply pointed spike; following this is a deep valley, the bottom of which is only 3 mm. in total thickness.  Finally the dorsum rises again to a curved knife-edged ridge extending over three quarters of the total length, and from this falling almost vertically to the head.  At the highest point of this anterior dorsal ridge, the depth is 6 mm.  There are apparently neither tubercles nor gland, although the carapace is more than adequate for protection against ants.  Length, 15 mm.  Pupa.  Resembles a seed capsule of the plant.  The posterior segments are contracted into a thin stalk which is fixed to a twig, and are articulated so that the head-case can be hammered against the surface of the twig when an enemy comes too close.  The whole pupa is so contracted that the overall length is only 6-7 mm.  The dorsum is rounded, the thorax slightly ridged, and in general the shape is semispherical and strongly reminiscent of a berry.  It is green with the exception of a large sepia brown patch on the thorax.  Locality.  Mt. Elgon, 18 miles S.W. of Kitale, Jan., 1932, and April, 1931.” Clark & Dickson, 1971: 138, plate 67  [as Epamera sidus; Port Alfred, Eastern Cape]. “Egg:  0.8 mm x 0.4 mm high.  Laid singly, normally, but sometimes in pairs.  Some eggs are covered with a yellow glutinous substance which gives the white egg a yellow appearance and is a partial protection against parasitical attack; some such eggs have, however, been found to have been parasitized.  Hatching occurs after some 8 days.  The discarded shell is not eaten.  Larva:  1st instar 1.25 mm, growing to 2.5 mm in 5-10 days; 2nd instar growing to 3.5 mm in 4-9 days; 3rd instar growing to 5.7 mm in 5-7 days; 4th instar growing to 13-15 mm in 13-19 days.  The discarded larval skin is eaten.  The honey-gland and tubercles are present in the 2nd to 4th instars.  Larvae in the 3rd and 4th instars resemble droppings of birds.  The colour of the final-instar larva varies from pale olive-green to green, some larvae of the latter colour having dark purple blotches round the spiracles.  Sometimes there are five instars, the extra instar being intermediate between the 3rd and 4th instars.  There is a rotation of broods.  Larvae can alter their appearance by pinching in the 8th segment and expanding the 3rd to 5th segments laterally.  The skin of the final-instar larva is fluted, somewhat like that of E. aemulus (as depicted round the illustration of the tubercle) and the setae are sunken in circular depressions.  Pupa:  10 mm.  Attached firmly to a twig by the cremastral hooks.  The main part of the pupa is generally well away from the twig and the pupa resembles a young, immature gall both in shape and colour.  If close to the twig, it taps on this when disturbed.  Normally the pupal state lasts for 13-14 days but, at times, up to 30 days are not uncommon; or the pupa may overwinter.  Parasites:  Egg.  Destroyed by small Chalcids (Trichogramma sp.?), despite the glutinous coating on the egg.  Larva.  Killed by Braconids.  Pupa.  Killed by various Ichneumonids; especially by a Pimpla sp.”  “Recorded from eggs and larvae from Port Alfred, eastern Cape Province.” Congdon et al., 2017 [final instar larva].

It is absent from Scotland and may now be extinct in Wales, although there are occasional sightings. In contrast, the butterfly is widespread and locally abundant in Ireland, where it has expanded northwards over the last 30 years. The Wood White was formerly quite widely distributed in England and Wales. Its decline began earlier than many other species and by the 1900s, the butterfly was extinct in several counties, including some where it has been abundant. The Wood White continued to decline during the twentieth century and, by the late 1970s, only 87 colonies were estimated to remain. During the 1980s, it declined substantially in Warwickshire and in the woodlands on the Surrey/Sussex borders from 20 sites to fewer than 1. The current survey indicates a major recent decline in Britain where it has been lost from 62% of the 10 km squares recording in 1970-82. Since the 1960s the Wood White has been introduced to a number of sites. Many...failed but at least two have resulted in sizeable colonies in north Bedfordshire and on the Buckinghamshire/Oxfordshire border. The recent records for Cumbria and Derbyshire are also suspected to be of released individuals. The butterfly's British strongholds are now in three main regions: Herefordshire and Worcestershire; Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire; and east Devon and south Somerset. In Ireland, the Wood White is far more widespread than in Britain, but becomes sparser in the far south (for example in Co. Cork; where there is less Meadow Vetchling in road verges, and in intensively farmed areas such as Co. Carlow.) It is under-recorded in some regions and is probably more widely distributed than shown. The butterfly expanded northwards during the fine summers of 1970s and 1980s, spreading particularly along railway lines, both used and disused. These habitats are believed to have acted as linear corridors enabling the butterfly to colonize many kilometres in just a few decades. However, this period of expansion now seems to be over and there were signs of a slight contraction in the 1990s. The Wood White is thought to be stable over much of its European range but has declined severely in Denmark (>75% decrease in 25 years) and to a lesser extent in Luxembourg (25-50%), Germany, Latvia, and European Turkey (15-25%). In woodland and scrub habitats, Wood White populations are known to fluctuate in response to the growth of surrounding trees and shading of its scrub-edge breeding habitats.; The butterfly has declined seriously in England and Wales. UK BAP Status: Species of Conservation Concern; Butterfly Conservation priority: medium; European Status: not threatened; Protected in Great Britain for sale only.; It has declined in a few European countries.","The Wood White is a delicate, slow-flying butterfly...; Males fly almost continuously in fine weather, patrolling to find a mate, whereas females spend much of their time feeding on flowers or resting.","The Wood White breeds in tall grassland or light scrub in partially shaded or edge habitats. In Britain, most colonies breed in woodland rides and clearings, though a few large colonies occur on coastal undercliffs. A few smaller colonies occur on disused railway lines and around rough, overgrown field edges (for example in north Devon). In Ireland, more open habitats are used, often far from woodland, including rough grassland with scrub, road verges, hedges, and disused railway lines.; By the 1970s, almost 50% of colonies occurred in ride alongside young conifer plantations.; usually encountered in sheltered situations such as woodland rides or scrub edges.","The eggs are laid singly on upper parts of foodplants, usually where they protrude above surrounding vegetation. In Britain, females prefer to lay eggs in light scrub or in the edges of sunny woodland rides. They rarely lay in very open areas and never fly into dense shade.","Various legumes are used, commonly Meadow Vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis), Bittervetch (L. linifolius), Tufted Vetch (Vicia cracea), Common Bird's-foot-trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), and Greater Bird's-foot-trefoil (L. pedunculatus). (Note that some vetches are not used, notably Bush Vetch (V. sepium), and Common Vetch (V. sativa).; [The larvae] tend to feed on younger, more nutritious growth at the top of foodplants. ",females spend much of their time feeding on flowers.,"There is one generation per year through most of its range, with adults flying from the end of May to the end of July.

In Ireland, it appears to have a looser colony structure as it does in continental Europe, often occurring at low densities over wide areas with concentrations only in the best breeding areas. Adults, usually males, are recorded sporadically many kilometres from known colonies and presumably represent dispersing individuals. There is little precise information on colonization range, but this must be considerable judging by its spread in Ireland over recent decades.; The butterfly expanded northwards during the fine summers of 1970s and 1980s, spreading particularly along railway lines, both used and disused.

In malayana from Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo, subapical dot is smaller than that of typical nina, and has rather conspicuous two greyish-green stripes on the underside hindwing. Fumigata from Lombok to Flores has subapical black dot fairly developed, and the beneath side is entirely stained. S. Celebesian dione is larger and has no apical marking.

Egg; 1.2mm high by O.5mm wide; 13 longitudinal ridges; color whiteblue. The egg is laid on the underside of a young leaf. In Luzon, larvae have Capparis rutidosperma as Appias oflerna. However the former eggs are found keeping in the shade, while the latter in the sun (Fukuda, 1974). Final instar larva; 17mm long by 2.5mm wide; grayish-green with a whitish spiracular line, above which is a dark border. Pupa; 13.6mm long; very transpalent green, often suffused with pink; cephalic projection shorter and thicker than African L. alcesta. Capparis heyeana and Cratatia relgicsa are known as larval food plants. We found larvae on Capparis zeylanica in the grounds of University of the Philippines. (Yata et al., 1978). Chromosome number: Formosan materials are examined by Maeki & Ae (1968); n=19. Bionomics: Butterfly is feeble in flight, never rises more than a foot or so from the ground. I think the flight may rather take effect to free from the attackers. It is a conspicuous insect when flying, however, when at rest it closes the wings and becomes nearly invisible by the protective marking of greenish striae and lines. They are delight in plain forests but are also found anywhere the food-plants grow. For instance, I found the eggs were laid on weeds, Capparis rutidosperma, in the shade on the flower beds of University of the Philippines.

[Notes] Oriental representative of Leptosia widely distributed from India to Lesser Sundas, Timor and Formosa. Nina has male genitaria quite different from African species, and may stand alone. Characters: Butterfly differs from African species as follows, 1) forewing above apical marking abruptly narrowed in space 5, 2) hindwing above marginal black border absent and 3) two conspicuous stripes on the underside hindwing. Male and female genitalia differ in the following points, 1) uncus longer, 2) tip of valva wider, 3) basal prong of phillus fairly developed and 4) signum of slender stick. Varieties: Sexes are alike. Female wings are much rounded. Various local forms occur. In malayana from Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo, subapical dot is smaller than that of typical nina, and has rather conspicuous two greyish-green stripes on the underside hindwing. Fumigata from Lombok to Flores has subapical black dot fairly developed, and the beneath side is entirely stained. S. Celebesian dione is larger and has no apical marking. In comma from Timor to Tanimbar, subapical black dot elongates along the vein 3 and joins the apical marking. Early Stages: Bell (1912-14) described them in detail. Egg; 1.2mm high by O.5mm wide; 13 longitudinal ridges; color whiteblue. The egg is laid on the underside of a young leaf. In Luzon, larvae have Capparis rutidosperma as Appias oflerna. However the former eggs are found keeping in the shade, while the latter in the sun (Fukuda, 1974). Final instar larva; 17mm long by 2.5mm wide; grayish-green with a whitish spiracular line, above which is a dark border. Pupa; 13.6mm long; very transpalent green, often suffused with pink; cephalic projection shorter and thicker than African L. alcesta. Capparis heyeana and Cratatia relgicsa are known as larval food plants. We found larvae on Capparis zeylanica in the grounds of University of the Philippines. (Yata et al., 1978). Chromosome number: Formosan materials are examined by Maeki & Ae (1968); n=19. Bionomics: Butterfly is feeble in flight, never rises more than a foot or so from the ground.

[Notes] Oriental representative of Leptosia widely distributed from India to Lesser Sundas, Timor and Formosa. Nina has male genitaria quite different from African species, and may stand alone. Characters: Butterfly differs from African species as follows, 1) forewing above apical marking abruptly narrowed in space 5, 2) hindwing above marginal black border absent and 3) two conspicuous stripes on the underside hindwing. Male and female genitalia differ in the following points, 1) uncus longer, 2) tip of valva wider, 3) basal prong of phillus fairly developed and 4) signum of slender stick. Varieties: Sexes are alike. Female wings are much rounded. Various local forms occur. In malayana from Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo, subapical dot is smaller than that of typical nina, and has rather conspicuous two greyish-green stripes on the underside hindwing. Fumigata from Lombok to Flores has subapical black dot fairly developed, and the beneath side is entirely stained. S. Celebesian dione is larger and has no apical marking. In comma from Timor to Tanimbar, subapical black dot elongates along the vein 3 and joins the apical marking. Early Stages: Bell (1912-14) described them in detail. Egg; 1.2mm high by O.5mm wide; 13 longitudinal ridges; color whiteblue. The egg is laid on the underside of a young leaf. In Luzon, larvae have Capparis rutidosperma as Appias oflerna. However the former eggs are found keeping in the shade, while the latter in the sun (Fukuda, 1974). Final instar larva; 17mm long by 2.5mm wide; grayish-green with a whitish spiracular line, above which is a dark border. Pupa; 13.6mm long; very transpalent green, often suffused with pink; cephalic projection shorter and thicker than African L. alcesta. Capparis heyeana and Cratatia relgicsa are known as larval food plants. We found larvae on Capparis zeylanica in the grounds of University of the Philippines. (Yata et al., 1978). Chromosome number: Formosan materials are examined by Maeki & Ae (1968); n=19. Bionomics: Butterfly is feeble in flight, never rises more than a foot or so from the ground. I think the flight may rather take effect to free from the attackers. It is a conspicuous insect when flying, however, when at rest it closes the wings and becomes nearly invisible by the protective marking of greenish striae and lines. They are delight in plain forests but are also found anywhere the food-plants grow. For instance, I found the eggs were laid on weeds, Capparis rutidosperma, in the shade on the flower beds of University of the Philippines.

[Notes] Oriental representative of Leptosia widely distributed from India to Lesser Sundas, Timor and Formosa. Nina has male genitaria quite different from African species, and may stand alone. Characters: Butterfly differs from African species as follows, 1) forewing above apical marking abruptly narrowed in space 5, 2) hindwing above marginal black border absent and 3) two conspicuous stripes on the underside hindwing. Male and female genitalia differ in the following points, 1) uncus longer, 2) tip of valva wider, 3) basal prong of phillus fairly developed and 4) signum of slender stick. Varieties: Sexes are alike. Female wings are much rounded. Various local forms occur. In malayana from Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo, subapical dot is smaller than that of typical nina, and has rather conspicuous two greyish-green stripes on the underside hindwing. Fumigata from Lombok to Flores has subapical black dot fairly developed, and the beneath side is entirely stained. S. Celebesian dione is larger and has no apical marking. In comma from Timor to Tanimbar, subapical black dot elongates along the vein 3 and joins the apical marking. Early Stages: Bell (1912-14) described them in detail. Egg; 1.2mm high by O.5mm wide; 13 longitudinal ridges; color whiteblue. The egg is laid on the underside of a young leaf. In Luzon, larvae have Capparis rutidosperma as Appias oflerna. However the former eggs are found keeping in the shade, while the latter in the sun (Fukuda, 1974). Final instar larva; 17mm long by 2.5mm wide; grayish-green with a whitish spiracular line, above which is a dark border. Pupa; 13.6mm long; very transpalent green, often suffused with pink; cephalic projection shorter and thicker than African L. alcesta. Capparis heyeana and Cratatia relgicsa are known as larval food plants. We found larvae on Capparis zeylanica in the grounds of University of the Philippines. (Yata et al., 1978). Chromosome number: Formosan materials are examined by Maeki & Ae (1968); n=19. Bionomics: Butterfly is feeble in flight, never rises more than a foot or so from the ground. I think the flight may rather take effect to free from the attackers. It is a conspicuous insect when flying, however, when at rest it closes the wings and becomes nearly invisible by the protective marking of greenish striae and lines. They are delight in plain forests but are also found anywhere the food-plants grow. For instance, I found the eggs were laid on weeds, Capparis rutidosperma, in the shade on the flower beds of University of the Philippines.

[Notes] Oriental representative of Leptosia widely distributed from India to Lesser Sundas, Timor and Formosa. Nina has male genitaria quite different from African species, and may stand alone. Characters: Butterfly differs from African species as follows, 1) forewing above apical marking abruptly narrowed in space 5, 2) hindwing above marginal black border absent and 3) two conspicuous stripes on the underside hindwing. Male and female genitalia differ in the following points, 1) uncus longer, 2) tip of valva wider, 3) basal prong of phillus fairly developed and 4) signum of slender stick. Varieties: Sexes are alike. Female wings are much rounded. Various local forms occur. In malayana from Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo, subapical dot is smaller than that of typical nina, and has rather conspicuous two greyish-green stripes on the underside hindwing. Fumigata from Lombok to Flores has subapical black dot fairly developed, and the beneath side is entirely stained. S. Celebesian dione is larger and has no apical marking. In comma from Timor to Tanimbar, subapical black dot elongates along the vein 3 and joins the apical marking. Early Stages: Bell (1912-14) described them in detail. Egg; 1.2mm high by O.5mm wide; 13 longitudinal ridges; color whiteblue. The egg is laid on the underside of a young leaf. In Luzon, larvae have Capparis rutidosperma as Appias oflerna. However the former eggs are found keeping in the shade, while the latter in the sun (Fukuda, 1974). Final instar larva; 17mm long by 2.5mm wide; grayish-green with a whitish spiracular line, above which is a dark border. Pupa; 13.6mm long; very transpalent green, often suffused with pink; cephalic projection shorter and thicker than African L. alcesta. Capparis heyeana and Cratatia relgicsa are known as larval food plants. We found larvae on Capparis zeylanica in the grounds of University of the Philippines. (Yata et al., 1978). Chromosome number: Formosan materials are examined by Maeki & Ae (1968); n=19. Bionomics: Butterfly is feeble in flight, never rises more than a foot or so from the ground. I think the flight may rather take effect to free from the attackers. It is a conspicuous insect when flying, however, when at rest it closes the wings and becomes nearly invisible by the protective marking of greenish striae and lines. They are delight in plain forests but are also found anywhere the food-plants grow. For instance, I found the eggs were laid on weeds, Capparis rutidosperma, in the shade on the flower beds of University of the Philippines.

It contains only 2 species. The type species, brassolis Westwood, 1864, designated by author, ranges throughout the Indo- Australian Region from northern India, through South-east Asia to the Moluccas, mainland NG, the Solomons and northern Australia. The other, grandis Weymer, 1902, is endemic to mainland PNG. Strand (1911a) discussed the genus in the Australian Subregion and newly described castnia from PNG as a species distinct from brassolis, for which he recognised 4 subspecies. However, he was unaware that his castnia was a synonym of L grandis described earlier by Weymer (1902). Eliot (1973) listed Sterosis C. & R. Felder, 1865, as a synonym of Liphyra. In the past, 5 African genera, including Liphyra, have been treated by some authors as a subfamily, Liphyrinae (e.g. Eliot, 1973), or even as a separate family, Liphyridae (e.g. Clench, 1955). However, Ehrlich (1960) showed that Liphyra is a typical member of the Lycaeninae, to which subfamily it is now correctly assigned. The most recent review of Liphyra is that of Samson and Smart (1980). The African genus Euliphyra Holland, 1890, is the nearest relative of Liphyra and both genera possess very similar genitalia, venation and early stages (Bethune-Baker, 1924). In both the males bear 5-segmented foretarsi and a pair of terminal claws, whereas in most other lycaenids the male tarsi are reduced to a single elongate segment without claws. Liphyra is also the only genus in the Indo-Australian Region with all veins present in the fore wings of both sexes. Eliot (in Corbet and Pendlebury, 1978) stated that ‘Liphyrinae’ is rather closely related to ‘Miletinae’. Liphyra adults are medium-sized butterflies which, for their family, is very large. In fact, they are the largest of all lycaenids. This appearance is enhanced by their stout, robust, very moth-like bodies. They are very cryptically coloured with dark brown wings and pale brown and orange markings. The genus exhibits little sexual dimorphism and the males lack secondary sexual characters such as sex-brands. The eye is smooth and the labial palpus is porrect and gradually tapered, being very small and shorter than the head. The Liphyra antenna is short, stout, and tapers gradually into a cylindrical club. The hindwing and forewing cells are about one-half the lengths of their respective wings. The hindwing termen is well-rounded, but the tomus is produced into a broad lobe at vein 1A+2A. The male genitalia are typically lycaenine, but the tegumen is strongly dorsally recurved so that it usually projects proximally almost as much as the saccus. In Liphyra, the proboscis is wholly atrophied so that adults apparently cannot feed during this stage of their life and so rely entirely on their fat reserves for sustenance. For example, Dodd (1902) pointed out that L. brassolis adults are: “very oily; in some instances grease came through abdomen in less than a week after setting. A thick layer of almost liquid grease lines the abdomen”. This partly explains why the Liphyra abdomen is so abnormally large and rounded. Additionally, it is probable that L. brassolis females have ovarian development similar to that described by Sands (1979b) in that their ovaries are well-developed (containing many mature ova) at eclosion from the pupa. Adult Liphyra are diurnal but also exhibit markedly crepuscular behaviour and, in PNG, of the few records of Liphyra adults known, most have been recorded as being attracted to lights in the evening twilight, when they have been captured. Due to their extremely moth-like and rather dull appearance they may be overlooked at such times and this may partly explain the paucity of records. However, Rothschild (1915b) suggested that the “extreme rarity” of specimens is probably due to their particularly specialised ant associated life histories. This is fully described below. The larvae, pupae and adults are remarkable for their specialised features of protection from Oecophylla smaragdina (the tailor, or green tree ant) in whose nests they occur and upon whose larvae they feed. Liphyra larvae do not produce glandular secretions of interest to their ant hosts as do the larvae of many other lycaenids. They are predacious on the ant larvae, and are thus ‘parasitic’ on the colony as a whole, hence their need for special armour-like protection from the O. smaragdina ants, which would otherwise not tolerate their presence within their nests. These are a tough, leathery, rather smooth skin and dome-shaped puparium. Interestingly, analogous protection has been evolved for apparently much the same reason by larvae of the syrphid fly genus, Microdon, in the USA and Mexico. The tough-skinned, dome-shaped syrphid larvae occur inside the nests of Formica species ants and possibly prey on the ant larvae (R. Snelling, pers. comm., 1995).",B_4558

Basically all Satyrinae can be divided into lowland and montane species. For example, the majority of Mycalesini are lowland species while most Lethini are high montane inhabitants. Many tropical species, as with species of temperate zones, prefer open areas, while many other species prefer shady undergrowth within forested habitats. A great number of Satyrinae species may be recorded in the tropical forest sub-canopy. Butterflies fly very close to the ground, often sitting either on the ground surface or on the leaves of herbs and shrubs. They often visit sunlit forest paths and trails. Many have a swift, short-lived flight when disturbed during the day and settle quickly with wings closed in near-by foliage. The majority of satyrids can be recorded in the vicinity of their foodplants which belong to monocotyledonous families such as Poaceae (grasses) and Arecaceae (palms). More information concerning habitats is in the relevant text for individual taxa. Such species as Melanitis leda, Elymnias hypermnestra, Ypthima baldus and some Mycalesis species can usually be found in secondary growth, countryside and urban gardens and parks. The males are distinctly territorial and patrol an area for mating. LIFE CYCLE The eggs are rather variable in shape but generally spherical and whitish or greenish in colour. The egg surface is usually smooth or faintly sculptured. Eggs are laid singly or in egg-masses. The majority of satyrid ovipositing activity occurs in the evening. Larvae (caterpillars) of the Satyridae have the head bifid often with a pair of long straight processes or “horns”, and the anal segment has a pair of posteriorly directed processes; the prothorax is constricted. They are usually green, yellow or brown in colour with some linear markings. Larvae of the majority of satyrins feed on monocotyledon plant species belonging to the Poaceae family. A number of species feed on different species of bamboo. Representatives of the genera Elymnias and Coelites feed on palm species (Arecaceae), growing in both forest habitats and cultivated areas. The species belonging to the Ragadia family feed on ferns belonging to the genus Selaginella. Caterpillars usually feed at night and rest lengthwise on the underside of the leaves during the day but some species move down the plant to rest near the ground. Larvae are usually sluggish and often slow-growing and usually remain motionless when disturbed. Some species are agricultural crop pests, for example, Melanitis leda is an occasional pest of rice. The pupae are usually smooth and green with or without yellow, reddish or woody brown markings and with a pair of variable, developed, cephalic horns. Adults of some genera are active throughout the day (e.g. Ypthima, Callerebia, Neope) and can be recorded in grassland, forest trails and mountain tops. However, the majority of Satyrinae are active at dawn and dusk; they are weak flyers and prefer shaded places in different types of forest",B_13726

Their undersides are very cryptically coloured and mottled with dark brown, the butterflies being perfectly camouflaged when resting on leaf litter. The mottling and size of the eye-spots of some species are often very variable. The crypsis of many species is enhanced by their irregular wing shape, some having markedly falcate forewings, and most with hindwing vein M3 produced into a short triangular ‘tail’. Bingham (1905) pointed out that, in India, Melanitis species have wet and dry season forms which are, respectively, well ocellated with numerous short striae underside, or poorly striated with the eye-spots often reduced to mere specks. Nevertheless, he noted that both forms also occur together and that many different hues of the underside ground colours occur. The Melanitis eye is smooth and the antenna is a little over two-fifths the length of the forewing costa. Miller (1968: 35, fig. 34) illustrated the venation of M. leda, and details of the labial palpus and legs (Miller, 1968: figs 35-39). The labial palpus apical segment is short, being only one-fourth the length of the second. The mid-tibia is unspined dorsally, although spines are present laterally. The tarsal claws of the hind leg are each bifid. The forewing cell is three-fifths the length of the costa and the forewing main veins are exceptional as, unlike other Satyrinae in PNG, none of them is basally inflated. The male genitalia are very simple, the uncus being beak-like and lacking a gnathos. The tegumen ring is broad, ending in a large elongate saccus, and the valva is simple and elongate, the inner lamina densely hirsute. The aedeagus is simple, tubular, but slightly tapers towards the apex, and the ductus enters distally so that there is no coecum. De Vries et al. (1985: 17) stated that Melanitis is certainly not closely related to Antirrhea Hubner, 1822, and Caerois, Htibner, 1819, as Miller (1968) had concluded. In fact, the latter 2 genera were shown to belong to the Morphinae, not Satyrinae as was traditionally believed. The authors observed that Melanitis and its allies are devoid of abdominal androconia and suggested that the genus is probably part of an Old World group that could well be related to Elymnias, Charaxes and Agrias. Corbet and Pendlebury (1978) pointed out that Cyllo genes Butler, 1868, an Indo-Burmese and Bornean genus, is closely related to Melanitis. Melanitis are all lowland species of the forest margin. The adults are all extremely crepuscular and become most active towards dusk, avoiding flight in sunlight unless disturbed, when they will dart off but quickly settle only a few metres away. They remain very inactive during the day, usually camouflaged amongst the leaf litter of the forest floor. They are sometimes also found in somewhat moister areas in the shade of steep creek banks. Adults favour rotting fruits as a food source and they also visit sap seepages. At dusk the males apparently occupy territories, or home ranges, and fly to investigate anything that moves within their immediate vicinity (e.g. see M. amabilis. Habits). Melanitis early stages are well recorded. The larvae feed exclusively on various grasses (Poaceae). M. leda larvae are a recorded pest of rice in India (e.g. Amn Singh, 1979), and Li (1985a, 1985b) similarly recorded M. leda as a pest of rice, and M. constantia as a pest of sugar cane, in PNG.",B_13726

Sexes are alike but the female is slightly paler. It is subject to seasonal polymorphism. The ocelli on the wsf are more prominent and silvery. The ocelli on the dsf are much smaller. The white discal band on the Un of both wings is rather variable. Length of FW: [Male] [Female] 23-26mm. HABITAT AND BIOLOGY. Ba Be N.P.: secondary vegetation in the vicinity of cultivated areas; Pu Hoat: scrub; Pu Mat: secondary forest at 200 to 1,000m. The larvae feed on grasses belonging to the Poaceae family, in particular Oryza sativa and Saccharum sp. (Chou, 1994). The species is rather common on the plains amongst grass growing under shade. SIMILAR SPECIES. Species of the genus Mycalesis which have no ocelli on the UpF, for example, M. adamsonii, M. inopia and M. deficiens, are somewhat similar.

(Tsukada call.) agricola ssp. nov. (Tsukada call.) [Notes] This species is a member of the Aristolochiae group, in which kotzebuea, polyphontes and polydorus are also included. It is widely distributed from India to Formosa and southward to the Lesser Sunda Islands. The species being favoured with geographic variation, twenty subspecies are known up to now. Besides, it shows considerable individual variation, and in some subspecies two forms, namely, the form with red-spotted wing and red body, and the form with yellow-spotted wing and yellow body, occur together. In many localities it serves as a model of the female of P. polytes. We figure twelve subspecies out of the fifteen occurring in the area here dealt with. Camorta from Nicobar, aphrodite from Sabang and antissa from Kangean were not available and not figured in this book. Almost in the center of its range, there lies the range of the black aristolochiae which lacks the central white patch on the hindwing. It occupies considerable area covering Palawan, Borneo, Sumatra, Nias, etc. No white-patched form has been known from the above districts, but in Java and Bali, the black forms are mixed in the white-patched forms. Usually the white-patched group of a ristolochiae is abundant in sunny grassland or open forest in lowland, while the black group is nowhere numerous and hardly considered as prosperous though it selects the same environment in lowland as its habitat. Among the black aristolochiae the one with curious tails is brevicauda of Palawan. Brevicauda is a name of a form meaning 'short tailed', but in this book we adopted it as the subspecific name on the grounds that by this shape of the tail the examples from Palawan could be clearly separable from others. In Palawan, the proportion of the long-tailed form to the short tailed one varies according to season, but short-tailed forms (PLATE 57-8, 9, 10; PLATE61-5) are predominant. Such a form does not occur elsewhere in aristolochiae. Butterflies in flight are sometimes mistaken for black semperi. In Palawan they hardly frequent primeval forest, usually living on grasslands along forest edges. In the Malay Peninsula the white-patched asteris is distributed. It has the longer wings and more slender tail than continental goniopeltis, and usually has the broader black stripes along veins 4, 5 on the hindwing above. It is common in lowlands. Examples figured in PLATE 57-2, 3 are melanic aberrations. 57-2 has only faint spots on the underside; 57-3 is a unique form almost lacking series of submarginal red spots and also white spot in space 1c, while it has clearly defined white spots in spaces 2, 3 and 4. The individuals with the obsolescent submarginal red spots are numerous in brevicauda in Palawan, the melanic form as figured in PLATE 61-5 being not so rare. The extremely darkened examples as may be mistaken for atropos, the one of which is figured in PLATE 61-6, are rare and treated as the aberrant form. In Palawan the species, together with P. a cropos and A. semperi, tends to be darkened, the phenomenon sometimes being called insular melanism. It is of much interest that the black aristolochiae subspecies, such as antiphus and agricola, are widely distributed ranging from Borneo to Tanajampea. In Selayar, the nearest island just north of Tanajampea, there occurs polyphontes, the separate species, and in Flores, south of it, the peculiar white-patched subspecies occurs. The example from Tanajampea is here separated as ssp. agricola as it has differently shaped submarginal red spots on the hindwing beneath. The comparative study of the submarginal red spots of black aristolochiae subspecies reveals that they are large, rectangular but slightly rounded in Borneo, Sumatra and Nias, small and rounded as usual in Lesser Sunda in lombokensis from Lombok and very slender, particularly in the female which has them crescent-shaped, in agricola from Tanajampea. The white-patched aristolochiae similar to the Continental form is distributed in Java, Bawean and Kangean. Examples from Bawean are similar to those from Java though we have few of them. A fine melanic aberration with the white spots obsolescent above is figured in PLATE 58-6. As in this case there seems to remain some melanic factor in Java. In the Lesser Sunda Islands from Bali and eastwards, the species has the red (yellow) spots on the hindwing beneath small and rounded. Balina from Bali is most variable in the indication of white spots probably as the island lies between Java and Lomook, changing from the one similar to Javan adamas to the one nearest to lombokensis from Lombok. It has the outwardly placed black spot in the white area in space Ic, this character being considered to be related to that of Java. Lombokensis is a black form, while austrosundana of the neighbouring Sumbawa is white-patched without exception, but the patch is not developed, only three spots being indicated in spaces 2,3 and 4. It occurs in two forms, namely, the yellowspotted (wing), yellow body form, and the red spotted (wing), red body form, and it has the centrally placed, black spot in the pink or yellowish white area in space 1c of the hindwing, which is regarded as an important feature of the subspecies. It is local in Sumbawa. The subspecies of Flores lacks this black spot in the pink area in space 1c, and has the well-developed central white spots in spaces 2-5, the character being peculiar among the subspecies of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is not abundant in Flores. It has not been recorded from Sumba. Probably due to the competition with P. oreon it is rare, and curiously enough, only the yellow-spotted, yeBow body form has been collected. It is a black aristolochiae subspecies without the white patch. Various species of Aristolochia are known as the larval food plants. Butterflies fly slow and visit many kinds of flowers. They usually occur in sub-montane zone, being abundant near human habitation, for instance, around villages, wastelands beside farms and graveyards. Rarely they are found to suck water.

Upperside hindwing with subtornal area of space 2 obscurely dusted with yellow scale. The rest of wing entirely black and unmarked. Underside forewing, basally blackish brown, space 1c almost black, with whitish vein stripes from vein 2 to costa, the stripes extend to outer half of cell. Underside hindwing, with submarginal series of seven yellow spots in spaces 1-7. The yellow spots small, and rounded and not clearly defined for they are black-dusted. Abdomen, with lateral and ventral sides dull yellow, dorsal side black. Clypeus covered with black-tipped dull yellow hair. It is a unique subspecies instantly separable from other subspecies by the above features. It is collected only at Lewa, C. Sumba. There also occurs P. oreon. It is noteworthy that P. oreon has the red submarginal spots while this species has them yellow. Very few specimens have been recorded in spite of the several researches. P. oreon, the competitive species is rather common. It represents the most southeastern extension of the a ristolochiae 's range. In Sumbawa, which lies to the north of Sumba, the yellow-spotted, yellow body form is collected, but it has the central white patch on the hindwing without exception. The new subspecific name means wisdom. Description Pachliopta aristolochiae agricola ssp. nov. (PLATE 59-7.8) MALE : A illustrated FEMALE: A illustrated Range : Tanajampea Holotype: [male] Tanajampea South of CELEBES 1978-Mar.-14 Paratypes: Tanajampea South of CELEBES 1979-Mar.- 14 (2 [male] 1 [female]), 1979-Mar.-16 (1 [female]) The form of this species occurrring in Tanajampea has been classified as belonging to antiphus, the subspecies of Borneo and Sumatra, but the black aristolochiae subspecies proved to be two-stemmed, namely, antiphus, brevicauda stem from Palawan, Borneo, Sumatra and Nias, and balina, lombokensis and sapientia stem from Lesser Sunda. The examples from Tanajampea are rather closely allied to Bornean antiphus as Bryk classified them. But such a distribution pattern as occurring limitedly in Borneo and Tanajampea is unexampled and the interpretation of the fact is very difficult. A careful study of the submarginal spots on the hindwing beneath revealed that there were difinite differences between antiphus from Borneo (and Sumatra) and examples from Tanajampea, and here we describe the latter as a separate new subspecies. Forewing similar to antiphus. Underside hindwing, submarginal red spots poorly indicated and narrow. The male has spot in space 5 obsolescent, spots in spaces 3, 4,6,7, very narrow except those in spaces I, 2. The female similar to the male, but with small, obsolescent red spot in space 5. Lunular spots in spaces 3, 4 chervon-shaped and peculiar. It is separable from antiphus which has red spots round or rectangular. The subspecific name means farmer.

The comparative study of the submarginal red spots of black aristolochiae subspecies reveals that they are large, rectangular but slightly rounded in Borneo, Sumatra and Nias, small and rounded as usual in Lesser Sunda in lombokensis from Lombok and very slender, particularly in the female which has them crescent-shaped, in agricola from Tanajampea. The white-patched aristolochiae similar to the Continental form is distributed in Java, Bawean and Kangean. Examples from Bawean are similar to those from Java though we have few of them. A fine melanic aberration with the white spots obsolescent above is figured in PLATE 58-6. As in this case there seems to remain some melanic factor in Java. In the Lesser Sunda Islands from Bali and eastwards, the species has the red (yellow) spots on the hindwing beneath small and rounded. Balina from Bali is most variable in the indication of white spots probably as the island lies between Java and Lomook, changing from the one similar to Javan adamas to the one nearest to lombokensis from Lombok. It has the outwardly placed black spot in the white area in space Ic, this character being considered to be related to that of Java. Lombokensis is a black form, while austrosundana of the neighbouring Sumbawa is white-patched without exception, but the patch is not developed, only three spots being indicated in spaces 2,3 and 4. It occurs in two forms, namely, the yellowspotted (wing), yellow body form, and the red spotted (wing), red body form, and it has the centrally placed, black spot in the pink or yellowish white area in space 1c of the hindwing, which is regarded as an important feature of the subspecies. It is local in Sumbawa. The subspecies of Flores lacks this black spot in the pink area in space 1c, and has the well-developed central white spots in spaces 2-5, the character being peculiar among the subspecies of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is not abundant in Flores. It has not been recorded from Sumba. Probably due to the competition with P. oreon it is rare, and curiously enough, only the yellow-spotted, yeBow body form has been collected. It is a black aristolochiae subspecies without the white patch. Various species of Aristolochia are known as the larval food plants. Butterflies fly slow and visit many kinds of flowers. They usually occur in sub-montane zone, being abundant near human habitation, for instance, around villages, wastelands beside farms and graveyards. Rarely they are found to suck water.

Underside forewing, basally blackish brown, space 1c almost black, with whitish vein stripes from vein 2 to costa, the stripes extend to outer half of cell. Underside hindwing, with submarginal series of seven yellow spots in spaces 1-7. The yellow spots small, and rounded and not clearly defined for they are black-dusted. Abdomen, with lateral and ventral sides dull yellow, dorsal side black. Clypeus covered with black-tipped dull yellow hair. It is a unique subspecies instantly separable from other subspecies by the above features. It is collected only at Lewa, C. Sumba. There also occurs P. oreon. It is noteworthy that P. oreon has the red submarginal spots while this species has them yellow. Very few specimens have been recorded in spite of the several researches. P. oreon, the competitive species is rather common. It represents the most southeastern extension of the a ristolochiae 's range. In Sumbawa, which lies to the north of Sumba, the yellow-spotted, yellow body form is collected, but it has the central white patch on the hindwing without exception. The new subspecific name means wisdom. Description Pachliopta aristolochiae agricola ssp. nov.

The examples from Tanajampea are rather closely allied to Bornean antiphus as Bryk classified them. But such a distribution pattern as occurring limitedly in Borneo and Tanajampea is unexampled and the interpretation of the fact is very difficult. A careful study of the submarginal spots on the hindwing beneath revealed that there were difinite differences between antiphus from Borneo (and Sumatra) and examples from Tanajampea, and here we describe the latter as a separate new subspecies. Forewing similar to antiphus. Underside hindwing, submarginal red spots poorly indicated and narrow. The male has spot in space 5 obsolescent, spots in spaces 3, 4,6,7, very narrow except those in spaces I, 2. The female similar to the male, but with small, obsolescent red spot in space 5. Lunular spots in spaces 3, 4 chervon-shaped and peculiar. It is separable from antiphus which has red spots round or rectangular. The subspecific name means farmer.

(Tsukada call.) agricola ssp. nov. (Tsukada call.) [Notes] This species is a member of the Aristolochiae group, in which kotzebuea, polyphontes and polydorus are also included. It is widely distributed from India to Formosa and southward to the Lesser Sunda Islands. The species being favoured with geographic variation, twenty subspecies are known up to now. Besides, it shows considerable individual variation, and in some subspecies two forms, namely, the form with red-spotted wing and red body, and the form with yellow-spotted wing and yellow body, occur together. In many localities it serves as a model of the female of P. polytes. We figure twelve subspecies out of the fifteen occurring in the area here dealt with. Camorta from Nicobar, aphrodite from Sabang and antissa from Kangean were not available and not figured in this book. Almost in the center of its range, there lies the range of the black aristolochiae which lacks the central white patch on the hindwing. It occupies considerable area covering Palawan, Borneo, Sumatra, Nias, etc. No white-patched form has been known from the above districts, but in Java and Bali, the black forms are mixed in the white-patched forms. Usually the white-patched group of a ristolochiae is abundant in sunny grassland or open forest in lowland, while the black group is nowhere numerous and hardly considered as prosperous though it selects the same environment in lowland as its habitat. Among the black aristolochiae the one with curious tails is brevicauda of Palawan. Brevicauda is a name of a form meaning 'short tailed', but in this book we adopted it as the subspecific name on the grounds that by this shape of the tail the examples from Palawan could be clearly separable from others. In Palawan, the proportion of the long-tailed form to the short tailed one varies according to season, but short-tailed forms (PLATE 57-8, 9, 10; PLATE61-5) are predominant. Such a form does not occur elsewhere in aristolochiae. Butterflies in flight are sometimes mistaken for black semperi. In Palawan they hardly frequent primeval forest, usually living on grasslands along forest edges. In the Malay Peninsula the white-patched asteris is distributed. It has the longer wings and more slender tail than continental goniopeltis, and usually has the broader black stripes along veins 4, 5 on the hindwing above. It is common in lowlands. Examples figured in PLATE 57-2, 3 are melanic aberrations. 57-2 has only faint spots on the underside; 57-3 is a unique form almost lacking series of submarginal red spots and also white spot in space 1c, while it has clearly defined white spots in spaces 2, 3 and 4. The individuals with the obsolescent submarginal red spots are numerous in brevicauda in Palawan, the melanic form as figured in PLATE 61-5 being not so rare. The extremely darkened examples as may be mistaken for atropos, the one of which is figured in PLATE 61-6, are rare and treated as the aberrant form. In Palawan the species, together with P. a cropos and A. semperi, tends to be darkened, the phenomenon sometimes being called insular melanism. It is of much interest that the black aristolochiae subspecies, such as antiphus and agricola, are widely distributed ranging from Borneo to Tanajampea. In Selayar, the nearest island just north of Tanajampea, there occurs polyphontes, the separate species, and in Flores, south of it, the peculiar white-patched subspecies occurs. The example from Tanajampea is here separated as ssp. agricola as it has differently shaped submarginal red spots on the hindwing beneath. The comparative study of the submarginal red spots of black aristolochiae subspecies reveals that they are large, rectangular but slightly rounded in Borneo, Sumatra and Nias, small and rounded as usual in Lesser Sunda in lombokensis from Lombok and very slender, particularly in the female which has them crescent-shaped, in agricola from Tanajampea. The white-patched aristolochiae similar to the Continental form is distributed in Java, Bawean and Kangean. Examples from Bawean are similar to those from Java though we have few of them. A fine melanic aberration with the white spots obsolescent above is figured in PLATE 58-6. As in this case there seems to remain some melanic factor in Java. In the Lesser Sunda Islands from Bali and eastwards, the species has the red (yellow) spots on the hindwing beneath small and rounded. Balina from Bali is most variable in the indication of white spots probably as the island lies between Java and Lomook, changing from the one similar to Javan adamas to the one nearest to lombokensis from Lombok. It has the outwardly placed black spot in the white area in space Ic, this character being considered to be related to that of Java. Lombokensis is a black form, while austrosundana of the neighbouring Sumbawa is white-patched without exception, but the patch is not developed, only three spots being indicated in spaces 2,3 and 4. It occurs in two forms, namely, the yellowspotted (wing), yellow body form, and the red spotted (wing), red body form, and it has the centrally placed, black spot in the pink or yellowish white area in space 1c of the hindwing, which is regarded as an important feature of the subspecies.

(Tsukada call.) agricola ssp. nov. (Tsukada call.) [Notes] This species is a member of the Aristolochiae group, in which kotzebuea, polyphontes and polydorus are also included. It is widely distributed from India to Formosa and southward to the Lesser Sunda Islands. The species being favoured with geographic variation, twenty subspecies are known up to now. Besides, it shows considerable individual variation, and in some subspecies two forms, namely, the form with red-spotted wing and red body, and the form with yellow-spotted wing and yellow body, occur together. In many localities it serves as a model of the female of P. polytes. We figure twelve subspecies out of the fifteen occurring in the area here dealt with. Camorta from Nicobar, aphrodite from Sabang and antissa from Kangean were not available and not figured in this book. Almost in the center of its range, there lies the range of the black aristolochiae which lacks the central white patch on the hindwing. It occupies considerable area covering Palawan, Borneo, Sumatra, Nias, etc. No white-patched form has been known from the above districts, but in Java and Bali, the black forms are mixed in the white-patched forms. Usually the white-patched group of a ristolochiae is abundant in sunny grassland or open forest in lowland, while the black group is nowhere numerous and hardly considered as prosperous though it selects the same environment in lowland as its habitat. Among the black aristolochiae the one with curious tails is brevicauda of Palawan. Brevicauda is a name of a form meaning 'short tailed', but in this book we adopted it as the subspecific name on the grounds that by this shape of the tail the examples from Palawan could be clearly separable from others. In Palawan, the proportion of the long-tailed form to the short tailed one varies according to season, but short-tailed forms (PLATE 57-8, 9, 10; PLATE61-5) are predominant. Such a form does not occur elsewhere in aristolochiae. Butterflies in flight are sometimes mistaken for black semperi. In Palawan they hardly frequent primeval forest, usually living on grasslands along forest edges. In the Malay Peninsula the white-patched asteris is distributed. It has the longer wings and more slender tail than continental goniopeltis, and usually has the broader black stripes along veins 4, 5 on the hindwing above. It is common in lowlands. Examples figured in PLATE 57-2, 3 are melanic aberrations. 57-2 has only faint spots on the underside; 57-3 is a unique form almost lacking series of submarginal red spots and also white spot in space 1c, while it has clearly defined white spots in spaces 2, 3 and 4. The individuals with the obsolescent submarginal red spots are numerous in brevicauda in Palawan, the melanic form as figured in PLATE 61-5 being not so rare. The extremely darkened examples as may be mistaken for atropos, the one of which is figured in PLATE 61-6, are rare and treated as the aberrant form. In Palawan the species, together with P. a cropos and A. semperi, tends to be darkened, the phenomenon sometimes being called insular melanism. It is of much interest that the black aristolochiae subspecies, such as antiphus and agricola, are widely distributed ranging from Borneo to Tanajampea. In Selayar, the nearest island just north of Tanajampea, there occurs polyphontes, the separate species, and in Flores, south of it, the peculiar white-patched subspecies occurs. The example from Tanajampea is here separated as ssp. agricola as it has differently shaped submarginal red spots on the hindwing beneath. The comparative study of the submarginal red spots of black aristolochiae subspecies reveals that they are large, rectangular but slightly rounded in Borneo, Sumatra and Nias, small and rounded as usual in Lesser Sunda in lombokensis from Lombok and very slender, particularly in the female which has them crescent-shaped, in agricola from Tanajampea. The white-patched aristolochiae similar to the Continental form is distributed in Java, Bawean and Kangean. Examples from Bawean are similar to those from Java though we have few of them. A fine melanic aberration with the white spots obsolescent above is figured in PLATE 58-6. As in this case there seems to remain some melanic factor in Java. In the Lesser Sunda Islands from Bali and eastwards, the species has the red (yellow) spots on the hindwing beneath small and rounded. Balina from Bali is most variable in the indication of white spots probably as the island lies between Java and Lomook, changing from the one similar to Javan adamas to the one nearest to lombokensis from Lombok. It has the outwardly placed black spot in the white area in space Ic, this character being considered to be related to that of Java. Lombokensis is a black form, while austrosundana of the neighbouring Sumbawa is white-patched without exception, but the patch is not developed, only three spots being indicated in spaces 2,3 and 4. It occurs in two forms, namely, the yellowspotted (wing), yellow body form, and the red spotted (wing), red body form, and it has the centrally placed, black spot in the pink or yellowish white area in space 1c of the hindwing, which is regarded as an important feature of the subspecies. It is local in Sumbawa. The subspecies of Flores lacks this black spot in the pink area in space 1c, and has the well-developed central white spots in spaces 2-5, the character being peculiar among the subspecies of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is not abundant in Flores. It has not been recorded from Sumba. Probably due to the competition with P. oreon it is rare, and curiously enough, only the yellow-spotted, yeBow body form has been collected. It is a black aristolochiae subspecies without the white patch. Various species of Aristolochia are known as the larval food plants. Butterflies fly slow and visit many kinds of flowers. They usually occur in sub-montane zone, being abundant near human habitation, for instance, around villages, wastelands beside farms and graveyards. Rarely they are found to suck water.

Upperside hindwing with subtornal area of space 2 obscurely dusted with yellow scale. The rest of wing entirely black and unmarked. Underside forewing, basally blackish brown, space 1c almost black, with whitish vein stripes from vein 2 to costa, the stripes extend to outer half of cell. Underside hindwing, with submarginal series of seven yellow spots in spaces 1-7. The yellow spots small, and rounded and not clearly defined for they are black-dusted. Abdomen, with lateral and ventral sides dull yellow, dorsal side black. Clypeus covered with black-tipped dull yellow hair. It is a unique subspecies instantly separable from other subspecies by the above features. It is collected only at Lewa, C. Sumba. There also occurs P. oreon. It is noteworthy that P. oreon has the red submarginal spots while this species has them yellow. Very few specimens have been recorded in spite of the several researches. P. oreon, the competitive species is rather common. It represents the most southeastern extension of the a ristolochiae 's range. In Sumbawa, which lies to the north of Sumba, the yellow-spotted, yellow body form is collected, but it has the central white patch on the hindwing without exception. The new subspecific name means wisdom. Description Pachliopta aristolochiae agricola ssp. nov.

The examples from Tanajampea are rather closely allied to Bornean antiphus as Bryk classified them. But such a distribution pattern as occurring limitedly in Borneo and Tanajampea is unexampled and the interpretation of the fact is very difficult. A careful study of the submarginal spots on the hindwing beneath revealed that there were difinite differences between antiphus from Borneo (and Sumatra) and examples from Tanajampea, and here we describe the latter as a separate new subspecies. Forewing similar to antiphus. Underside hindwing, submarginal red spots poorly indicated and narrow. The male has spot in space 5 obsolescent, spots in spaces 3, 4,6,7, very narrow except those in spaces I, 2. The female similar to the male, but with small, obsolescent red spot in space 5. Lunular spots in spaces 3, 4 chervon-shaped and peculiar. It is separable from antiphus which has red spots round or rectangular. The subspecific name means farmer.

(Tsukada call.) agricola ssp. nov. (Tsukada call.) [Notes] This species is a member of the Aristolochiae group, in which kotzebuea, polyphontes and polydorus are also included. It is widely distributed from India to Formosa and southward to the Lesser Sunda Islands. The species being favoured with geographic variation, twenty subspecies are known up to now. Besides, it shows considerable individual variation, and in some subspecies two forms, namely, the form with red-spotted wing and red body, and the form with yellow-spotted wing and yellow body, occur together. In many localities it serves as a model of the female of P. polytes. We figure twelve subspecies out of the fifteen occurring in the area here dealt with. Camorta from Nicobar, aphrodite from Sabang and antissa from Kangean were not available and not figured in this book. Almost in the center of its range, there lies the range of the black aristolochiae which lacks the central white patch on the hindwing. It occupies considerable area covering Palawan, Borneo, Sumatra, Nias, etc. No white-patched form has been known from the above districts, but in Java and Bali, the black forms are mixed in the white-patched forms. Usually the white-patched group of a ristolochiae is abundant in sunny grassland or open forest in lowland, while the black group is nowhere numerous and hardly considered as prosperous though it selects the same environment in lowland as its habitat. Among the black aristolochiae the one with curious tails is brevicauda of Palawan. Brevicauda is a name of a form meaning 'short tailed', but in this book we adopted it as the subspecific name on the grounds that by this shape of the tail the examples from Palawan could be clearly separable from others. In Palawan, the proportion of the long-tailed form to the short tailed one varies according to season, but short-tailed forms (PLATE 57-8, 9, 10; PLATE61-5) are predominant. Such a form does not occur elsewhere in aristolochiae. Butterflies in flight are sometimes mistaken for black semperi. In Palawan they hardly frequent primeval forest, usually living on grasslands along forest edges. In the Malay Peninsula the white-patched asteris is distributed. It has the longer wings and more slender tail than continental goniopeltis, and usually has the broader black stripes along veins 4, 5 on the hindwing above. It is common in lowlands. Examples figured in PLATE 57-2, 3 are melanic aberrations. 57-2 has only faint spots on the underside; 57-3 is a unique form almost lacking series of submarginal red spots and also white spot in space 1c, while it has clearly defined white spots in spaces 2, 3 and 4. The individuals with the obsolescent submarginal red spots are numerous in brevicauda in Palawan, the melanic form as figured in PLATE 61-5 being not so rare. The extremely darkened examples as may be mistaken for atropos, the one of which is figured in PLATE 61-6, are rare and treated as the aberrant form. In Palawan the species, together with P. a cropos and A. semperi, tends to be darkened, the phenomenon sometimes being called insular melanism. It is of much interest that the black aristolochiae subspecies, such as antiphus and agricola, are widely distributed ranging from Borneo to Tanajampea. In Selayar, the nearest island just north of Tanajampea, there occurs polyphontes, the separate species, and in Flores, south of it, the peculiar white-patched subspecies occurs. The example from Tanajampea is here separated as ssp. agricola as it has differently shaped submarginal red spots on the hindwing beneath. The comparative study of the submarginal red spots of black aristolochiae subspecies reveals that they are large, rectangular but slightly rounded in Borneo, Sumatra and Nias, small and rounded as usual in Lesser Sunda in lombokensis from Lombok and very slender, particularly in the female which has them crescent-shaped, in agricola from Tanajampea. The white-patched aristolochiae similar to the Continental form is distributed in Java, Bawean and Kangean. Examples from Bawean are similar to those from Java though we have few of them. A fine melanic aberration with the white spots obsolescent above is figured in PLATE 58-6. As in this case there seems to remain some melanic factor in Java. In the Lesser Sunda Islands from Bali and eastwards, the species has the red (yellow) spots on the hindwing beneath small and rounded. Balina from Bali is most variable in the indication of white spots probably as the island lies between Java and Lomook, changing from the one similar to Javan adamas to the one nearest to lombokensis from Lombok. It has the outwardly placed black spot in the white area in space Ic, this character being considered to be related to that of Java. Lombokensis is a black form, while austrosundana of the neighbouring Sumbawa is white-patched without exception, but the patch is not developed, only three spots being indicated in spaces 2,3 and 4. It occurs in two forms, namely, the yellowspotted (wing), yellow body form, and the red spotted (wing), red body form, and it has the centrally placed, black spot in the pink or yellowish white area in space 1c of the hindwing, which is regarded as an important feature of the subspecies. It is local in Sumbawa. The subspecies of Flores lacks this black spot in the pink area in space 1c, and has the well-developed central white spots in spaces 2-5, the character being peculiar among the subspecies of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is not abundant in Flores. It has not been recorded from Sumba. Probably due to the competition with P. oreon it is rare, and curiously enough, only the yellow-spotted, yeBow body form has been collected. It is a black aristolochiae subspecies without the white patch. Various species of Aristolochia are known as the larval food plants. Butterflies fly slow and visit many kinds of flowers. They usually occur in sub-montane zone, being abundant near human habitation, for instance, around villages, wastelands beside farms and graveyards. Rarely they are found to suck water.

Underside forewing, basally blackish brown, space 1c almost black, with whitish vein stripes from vein 2 to costa, the stripes extend to outer half of cell. Underside hindwing, with submarginal series of seven yellow spots in spaces 1-7. The yellow spots small, and rounded and not clearly defined for they are black-dusted. Abdomen, with lateral and ventral sides dull yellow, dorsal side black. Clypeus covered with black-tipped dull yellow hair. It is a unique subspecies instantly separable from other subspecies by the above features. It is collected only at Lewa, C. Sumba. There also occurs P. oreon. It is noteworthy that P. oreon has the red submarginal spots while this species has them yellow. Very few specimens have been recorded in spite of the several researches. P. oreon, the competitive species is rather common. It represents the most southeastern extension of the a ristolochiae 's range. In Sumbawa, which lies to the north of Sumba, the yellow-spotted, yellow body form is collected, but it has the central white patch on the hindwing without exception.

The examples from Tanajampea are rather closely allied to Bornean antiphus as Bryk classified them. But such a distribution pattern as occurring limitedly in Borneo and Tanajampea is unexampled and the interpretation of the fact is very difficult. A careful study of the submarginal spots on the hindwing beneath revealed that there were difinite differences between antiphus from Borneo (and Sumatra) and examples from Tanajampea, and here we describe the latter as a separate new subspecies. Forewing similar to antiphus. Underside hindwing, submarginal red spots poorly indicated and narrow. The male has spot in space 5 obsolescent, spots in spaces 3, 4,6,7, very narrow except those in spaces I, 2. The female similar to the male, but with small, obsolescent red spot in space 5.

S.Vietnam : Poulo Condore, Pont Sur le Song Larna, Nui Ong Yem, Dinh Quan forest. Cat Tien N.P. There are no major differences between specimens from northern, central and southern populations. The specimens from N. Vietnam (Lao Cai province) are insignificantly larger in size, and have slightly longer white spots in spaces 2 ,3 ,4 and 5 of the HW. A whitish spot or dot within the cell is rather frequent; the UpH is darker and the submarginal spots redder and more distinct. Both sexes are variable in size, however the female is larger. Length of FW: [female] 47-51 mm; [male] 42-48 mm. TAXONOMIC NOTES. The Vietnamese populations are similar to subspecies goniopeltis Rothschild, mentioned from s. & c. Vietnam (Metaye, 1957) and also noted from N. Vietnam and s. China (Bascombe et al., 1991). HABITAT AND BIOLOGY. In the north of the country the species occurs from April to September. The night period in C. Vietnam was observed from January (southern sites) and March to October and November. In the south it was recorded at all times of the year. The species is found in secondary vegetation and is attracted to Bowering bushes and herbs. It nies rather slowly and low, with night conducted by the FW and using the H W for balance. The larvae feed on Aristolochia spp. (Aristolochia tagala, A. indica, A. griffithi and A.fordiana) and adults are toxic to birds. SIMILAR SPECIES. Flying species may be confused with L. coon and some Byasa and with the female of Papilio polytes, though the last species has a black abdomen. ",B_16503

(Tsukada call.) agricola ssp. nov. (Tsukada call.) [Notes] This species is a member of the Aristolochiae group, in which kotzebuea, polyphontes and polydorus are also included. It is widely distributed from India to Formosa and southward to the Lesser Sunda Islands. The species being favoured with geographic variation, twenty subspecies are known up to now. Besides, it shows considerable individual variation, and in some subspecies two forms, namely, the form with red-spotted wing and red body, and the form with yellow-spotted wing and yellow body, occur together. In many localities it serves as a model of the female of P. polytes. We figure twelve subspecies out of the fifteen occurring in the area here dealt with. Camorta from Nicobar, aphrodite from Sabang and antissa from Kangean were not available and not figured in this book. Almost in the center of its range, there lies the range of the black aristolochiae which lacks the central white patch on the hindwing. It occupies considerable area covering Palawan, Borneo, Sumatra, Nias, etc. No white-patched form has been known from the above districts, but in Java and Bali, the black forms are mixed in the white-patched forms. Usually the white-patched group of a ristolochiae is abundant in sunny grassland or open forest in lowland, while the black group is nowhere numerous and hardly considered as prosperous though it selects the same environment in lowland as its habitat. Among the black aristolochiae the one with curious tails is brevicauda of Palawan. Brevicauda is a name of a form meaning 'short tailed', but in this book we adopted it as the subspecific name on the grounds that by this shape of the tail the examples from Palawan could be clearly separable from others. In Palawan, the proportion of the long-tailed form to the short tailed one varies according to season, but short-tailed forms (PLATE 57-8, 9, 10; PLATE61-5) are predominant. Such a form does not occur elsewhere in aristolochiae. Butterflies in flight are sometimes mistaken for black semperi. In Palawan they hardly frequent primeval forest, usually living on grasslands along forest edges. In the Malay Peninsula the white-patched asteris is distributed. It has the longer wings and more slender tail than continental goniopeltis, and usually has the broader black stripes along veins 4, 5 on the hindwing above. It is common in lowlands. Examples figured in PLATE 57-2, 3 are melanic aberrations. 57-2 has only faint spots on the underside; 57-3 is a unique form almost lacking series of submarginal red spots and also white spot in space 1c, while it has clearly defined white spots in spaces 2, 3 and 4. The individuals with the obsolescent submarginal red spots are numerous in brevicauda in Palawan, the melanic form as figured in PLATE 61-5 being not so rare. The extremely darkened examples as may be mistaken for atropos, the one of which is figured in PLATE 61-6, are rare and treated as the aberrant form. In Palawan the species, together with P. a cropos and A. semperi, tends to be darkened, the phenomenon sometimes being called insular melanism. It is of much interest that the black aristolochiae subspecies, such as antiphus and agricola, are widely distributed ranging from Borneo to Tanajampea. In Selayar, the nearest island just north of Tanajampea, there occurs polyphontes, the separate species, and in Flores, south of it, the peculiar white-patched subspecies occurs. The example from Tanajampea is here separated as ssp. agricola as it has differently shaped submarginal red spots on the hindwing beneath. The comparative study of the submarginal red spots of black aristolochiae subspecies reveals that they are large, rectangular but slightly rounded in Borneo, Sumatra and Nias, small and rounded as usual in Lesser Sunda in lombokensis from Lombok and very slender, particularly in the female which has them crescent-shaped, in agricola from Tanajampea. The white-patched aristolochiae similar to the Continental form is distributed in Java, Bawean and Kangean. Examples from Bawean are similar to those from Java though we have few of them. A fine melanic aberration with the white spots obsolescent above is figured in PLATE 58-6. As in this case there seems to remain some melanic factor in Java. In the Lesser Sunda Islands from Bali and eastwards, the species has the red (yellow) spots on the hindwing beneath small and rounded. Balina from Bali is most variable in the indication of white spots probably as the island lies between Java and Lomook, changing from the one similar to Javan adamas to the one nearest to lombokensis from Lombok. It has the outwardly placed black spot in the white area in space Ic, this character being considered to be related to that of Java. Lombokensis is a black form, while austrosundana of the neighbouring Sumbawa is white-patched without exception, but the patch is not developed, only three spots being indicated in spaces 2,3 and 4. It occurs in two forms, namely, the yellowspotted (wing), yellow body form, and the red spotted (wing), red body form, and it has the centrally placed, black spot in the pink or yellowish white area in space 1c of the hindwing, which is regarded as an important feature of the subspecies. It is local in Sumbawa. The subspecies of Flores lacks this black spot in the pink area in space 1c, and has the well-developed central white spots in spaces 2-5, the character being peculiar among the subspecies of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is not abundant in Flores. It has not been recorded from Sumba. Probably due to the competition with P. oreon it is rare, and curiously enough, only the yellow-spotted, yeBow body form has been collected. It is a black aristolochiae subspecies without the white patch. Various species of Aristolochia are known as the larval food plants. Butterflies fly slow and visit many kinds of flowers. They usually occur in sub-montane zone, being abundant near human habitation, for instance, around villages, wastelands beside farms and graveyards. Rarely they are found to suck water.

Upperside hindwing with subtornal area of space 2 obscurely dusted with yellow scale. The rest of wing entirely black and unmarked. Underside forewing, basally blackish brown, space 1c almost black, with whitish vein stripes from vein 2 to costa, the stripes extend to outer half of cell. Underside hindwing, with submarginal series of seven yellow spots in spaces 1-7. The yellow spots small, and rounded and not clearly defined for they are black-dusted. Abdomen, with lateral and ventral sides dull yellow, dorsal side black. Clypeus covered with black-tipped dull yellow hair. It is a unique subspecies instantly separable from other subspecies by the above features. It is collected only at Lewa, C. Sumba. There also occurs P. oreon. It is noteworthy that P. oreon has the red submarginal spots while this species has them yellow. Very few specimens have been recorded in spite of the several researches. P. oreon, the competitive species is rather common. It represents the most southeastern extension of the a ristolochiae 's range. In Sumbawa, which lies to the north of Sumba, the yellow-spotted, yellow body form is collected, but it has the central white patch on the hindwing without exception. The new subspecific name means wisdom. Description Pachliopta aristolochiae agricola ssp. nov. (PLATE 59-7.8) MALE : A illustrated FEMALE: A illustrated Range : Tanajampea Holotype: [male] Tanajampea South of CELEBES 1978-Mar.-14 Paratypes: Tanajampea South of CELEBES 1979-Mar.- 14 (2 [male] 1 [female]), 1979-Mar.-16 (1 [female]) The form of this species occurrring in Tanajampea has been classified as belonging to antiphus, the subspecies of Borneo and Sumatra, but the black aristolochiae subspecies proved to be two-stemmed, namely, antiphus, brevicauda stem from Palawan, Borneo, Sumatra and Nias, and balina, lombokensis and sapientia stem from Lesser Sunda. The examples from Tanajampea are rather closely allied to Bornean antiphus as Bryk classified them. But such a distribution pattern as occurring limitedly in Borneo and Tanajampea is unexampled and the interpretation of the fact is very difficult. A careful study of the submarginal spots on the hindwing beneath revealed that there were difinite differences between antiphus from Borneo (and Sumatra) and examples from Tanajampea, and here we describe the latter as a separate new subspecies. Forewing similar to antiphus. Underside hindwing, submarginal red spots poorly indicated and narrow. The male has spot in space 5 obsolescent, spots in spaces 3, 4,6,7, very narrow except those in spaces I, 2. The female similar to the male, but with small, obsolescent red spot in space 5. Lunular spots in spaces 3, 4 chervon-shaped and peculiar. It is separable from antiphus which has red spots round or rectangular. The subspecific name means farmer.

In other areas res em bles black aristolochiae lacking the white patch in the centre of the hindwing. Atropos can be distinguished by the absence of series of submarginal red spots on the hindwing and the more slender and longer tail. Besides it is unique in lacking the basal dark area of the forewing, which is always present in other Pachliopta. aristolochiae Within the Philippine area distributed only in Palawan. It is separable from kotzebuea by that it has neither red spots nor white ones on the central area of the hindwing beneath. Kotzebuea is a replacing species of aristolochiae. Palawan subspecies brevicauda closely resembles autiphus from Borneo and Sumatra, but it has shorter tail and submarginal red spots on the hindwing beneath undeveloped. kotzebuea The nominate subspecies is unique in having the entirely black forewing. It lacks whitespots in the centreof the hindwing above. In some individuals whitish stripes are perceptible in the distal area of space Ion the forewing beneath, which recalls the basal dark area in typical Pachliopta. The red spots in the centre of the hindwing vary individually, some with welldeveloped ones, others obsolescent, and red or pinkish white in colour. In asina from N. Luzon the basal dark area of the forewing is clearly defined. The hindwing is black above, but in individuals with well-developed submarginal red spots, the spots appear above too. The spots in the centre of the hindwing beneath are variable, being red, pink or even white in colour. It is similar to schadenbergi but is easily separable by that kotzebuea has submarginal concolorous red spots in spaces 1-7 on the hindwing, while schadenbergi has white spots in spaces 5,6 and 7. S. Philippine philippus has white spots in the centre of the hindwing, being similar to phegeus, ley tens is and mariae, etc. The above white spots vary individually and are not available as key characters. The spots extend to spaces 5, 6 if welldeveloped, while they are limited to spaces 2-4, just as phegeus, if not developed. From other allied species it can be separated by its submarginal concolorous red spots in spaces 1-7 on the hindwing. Rarely individuals with the white cell spot on the hindwing are found, but usually the cell is unspotted. scchadenbergi It occurs together with kotzebuea asina in various areas of N. Luzon and most similar to the subspecies, but it is easily separable from others by that it lacks spots in the centre of the hindwing beneath, and it has submarginal series of spots on the hindwing well-developed and large, of which the spots in spaces 2, 3 are beautiful red and the ones in spaces 4-7 are partly white. The subspecies from E. Luzon has the submarginal area of the hindwing conspicuously whitened.  phegeus Usually lacks the white ceU spot on the hindwing. Examples from Leyte have it rarely. Separable from mariae, phlegon and leytensis by the absence of the white cell spot. Most brightly coloured among the species with submarginal red spots. Usually it has five red spots in spaces 1-5. The submarginal spots are well-developed and beautiful red. The spots become extinct or very small and white in spaces 6-7. Very similar to leytensis, but easily separable from it by the absence of the white cell spot on the hindwing and the brighter red of submarginal spots on the hindwing above. leytensis Among the three species with the spot in the hindwing cell this species has the smallest and nearly round spot. On the hindwing submarginal red spots are large in spaces 2, 3 and small in spaces 4-7. It is separable from mariae and phlegon by its whitened submarginal spots in spaces 6, 7. It is also similar to Phegeus, but its white central patch on the hindwing always extends to space 5, and submarginal spots on the hindwing are not so clearly defined as in Phegeus. It resembles mariae in having small spots in spaces 6,7, butleytensis usually lacks red spot in space 1. The spots are bright red in phegeus, paler red except the bright red one in space 1 in mariae, and large and black-dusted in spaces 2, 3 in leytensis. phlegon The white spots in the centre of the hindwing are most developed. It has the largest cell spot of the Philippine Pachliopta. The spot is usually larger than half of the cell, sometimes occupying two-thirds, with six white spots around it. The white spot in space 2 extends to the extreme base, while in phegeus, leytensis, kotzebuea and aristolochiae the base of space 2 triangularly blackened. Only two species, phlegon and muriae, have the base of space 2 white. Phlegon has the submarginal spots on the hindwing weakly developed, and is easily separable from other species by the larger white spot in space 1 on the hindwing. It occurs in two forms; one is redspotted, the other yellow-spotted. mariae The white cell spot on the hindwing is smaller than Phegeus, its size being less than one half of the cell. In the subspecies of S. Luzon and Potillo the upper angle of the white cell spot reaches the origin of vein 6, but in the nominate subspecies it usually does not reach discocellular veins. In mariae, as in Phlegon, the white spot in space 2 extends to the base of the space. Usually five white spots encircle the cell. Subspecies from S. Luzon and Polillo have the weakly developed white spot in space 1, and usually four white spots encircle the cell. This species has black hairs on the clypeus of the head, being instantly separable from other species with red or yellow hairs on it.",B_16503

In Palawan they hardly frequent primeval forest, usually living on grasslands along forest edges. In the Malay Peninsula the white-patched asteris is distributed. It has the longer wings and more slender tail than continental goniopeltis, and usually has the broader black stripes along veins 4, 5 on the hindwing above. It is common in lowlands. Examples figured in PLATE 57-2, 3 are melanic aberrations. 57-2 has only faint spots on the underside; 57-3 is a unique form almost lacking series of submarginal red spots and also white spot in space 1c, while it has clearly defined white spots in spaces 2, 3 and 4. The individuals with the obsolescent submarginal red spots are numerous in brevicauda in Palawan, the melanic form as figured in PLATE 61-5 being not so rare. The extremely darkened examples as may be mistaken for atropos, the one of which is figured in PLATE 61-6, are rare and treated as the aberrant form. In Palawan the species, together with P. a cropos and A. semperi, tends to be darkened, the phenomenon sometimes being called insular melanism. It is of much interest that the black aristolochiae subspecies, such as antiphus and agricola, are widely distributed ranging from Borneo to Tanajampea. In Selayar, the nearest island just north of Tanajampea, there occurs polyphontes, the separate species, and in Flores, south of it, the peculiar white-patched subspecies occurs. The example from Tanajampea is here separated as ssp. agricola as it has differently shaped submarginal red spots on the hindwing beneath. The comparative study of the submarginal red spots of black aristolochiae subspecies reveals that they are large, rectangular but slightly rounded in Borneo, Sumatra and Nias, small and rounded as usual in Lesser Sunda in lombokensis from Lombok and very slender, particularly in the female which has them crescent-shaped, in agricola from Tanajampea. The white-patched aristolochiae similar to the Continental form is distributed in Java, Bawean and Kangean. Examples from Bawean are similar to those from Java though we have few of them. A fine melanic aberration with the white spots obsolescent above is figured in PLATE 58-6. As in this case there seems to remain some melanic factor in Java. In the Lesser Sunda Islands from Bali and eastwards, the species has the red (yellow) spots on the hindwing beneath small and rounded. Balina from Bali is most variable in the indication of white spots probably as the island lies between Java and Lomook, changing from the one similar to Javan adamas to the one nearest to lombokensis from Lombok. It has the outwardly placed black spot in the white area in space Ic, this character being considered to be related to that of Java. Lombokensis is a black form, while austrosundana of the neighbouring Sumbawa is white-patched without exception, but the patch is not developed, only three spots being indicated in spaces 2,3 and 4. It occurs in two forms, namely, the yellowspotted (wing), yellow body form, and the red spotted (wing), red body form, and it has the centrally placed, black spot in the pink or yellowish white area in space 1c of the hindwing, which is regarded as an important feature of the subspecies. It is local in Sumbawa. The subspecies of Flores lacks this black spot in the pink area in space 1c, and has the well-developed central white spots in spaces 2-5, the character being peculiar among the subspecies of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is not abundant in Flores. It has not been recorded from Sumba. Probably due to the competition with P. oreon it is rare, and curiously enough, only the yellow-spotted, yeBow body form has been collected. It is a black aristolochiae subspecies without the white patch. Various species of Aristolochia are known as the larval food plants. Butterflies fly slow and visit many kinds of flowers. They usually occur in sub-montane zone, being abundant near human habitation, for instance, around villages, wastelands beside farms and graveyards. Rarely they are found to suck water.

Upperside hindwing with subtornal area of space 2 obscurely dusted with yellow scale. The rest of wing entirely black and unmarked. Underside forewing, basally blackish brown, space 1c almost black, with whitish vein stripes from vein 2 to costa, the stripes extend to outer half of cell. Underside hindwing, with submarginal series of seven yellow spots in spaces 1-7. The yellow spots small, and rounded and not clearly defined for they are black-dusted. Abdomen, with lateral and ventral sides dull yellow, dorsal side black. Clypeus covered with black-tipped dull yellow hair. It is a unique subspecies instantly separable from other subspecies by the above features. It is collected only at Lewa, C. Sumba. There also occurs P. oreon. It is noteworthy that P. oreon has the red submarginal spots while this species has them yellow. Very few specimens have been recorded in spite of the several researches. P. oreon, the competitive species is rather common. It represents the most southeastern extension of the a ristolochiae 's range. In Sumbawa, which lies to the north of Sumba, the yellow-spotted, yellow body form is collected, but it has the central white patch on the hindwing without exception. The new subspecific name means wisdom. Description Pachliopta aristolochiae agricola ssp. nov.

The examples from Tanajampea are rather closely allied to Bornean antiphus as Bryk classified them. But such a distribution pattern as occurring limitedly in Borneo and Tanajampea is unexampled and the interpretation of the fact is very difficult. A careful study of the submarginal spots on the hindwing beneath revealed that there were difinite differences between antiphus from Borneo (and Sumatra) and examples from Tanajampea, and here we describe the latter as a separate new subspecies. Forewing similar to antiphus. Underside hindwing, submarginal red spots poorly indicated and narrow. The male has spot in space 5 obsolescent, spots in spaces 3, 4,6,7, very narrow except those in spaces I, 2. The female similar to the male, but with small, obsolescent red spot in space 5. Lunular spots in spaces 3, 4 chervon-shaped and peculiar. It is separable from antiphus which has red spots round or rectangular. The subspecific name means farmer.

(Tsukada call.) agricola ssp. nov. (Tsukada call.) [Notes] This species is a member of the Aristolochiae group, in which kotzebuea, polyphontes and polydorus are also included. It is widely distributed from India to Formosa and southward to the Lesser Sunda Islands. The species being favoured with geographic variation, twenty subspecies are known up to now. Besides, it shows considerable individual variation, and in some subspecies two forms, namely, the form with red-spotted wing and red body, and the form with yellow-spotted wing and yellow body, occur together. In many localities it serves as a model of the female of P. polytes. We figure twelve subspecies out of the fifteen occurring in the area here dealt with. Camorta from Nicobar, aphrodite from Sabang and antissa from Kangean were not available and not figured in this book. Almost in the center of its range, there lies the range of the black aristolochiae which lacks the central white patch on the hindwing. It occupies considerable area covering Palawan, Borneo, Sumatra, Nias, etc. No white-patched form has been known from the above districts, but in Java and Bali, the black forms are mixed in the white-patched forms. Usually the white-patched group of a ristolochiae is abundant in sunny grassland or open forest in lowland, while the black group is nowhere numerous and hardly considered as prosperous though it selects the same environment in lowland as its habitat. Among the black aristolochiae the one with curious tails is brevicauda of Palawan. Brevicauda is a name of a form meaning 'short tailed', but in this book we adopted it as the subspecific name on the grounds that by this shape of the tail the examples from Palawan could be clearly separable from others. In Palawan, the proportion of the long-tailed form to the short tailed one varies according to season, but short-tailed forms (PLATE 57-8, 9, 10; PLATE61-5) are predominant. Such a form does not occur elsewhere in aristolochiae. Butterflies in flight are sometimes mistaken for black semperi. In Palawan they hardly frequent primeval forest, usually living on grasslands along forest edges. In the Malay Peninsula the white-patched asteris is distributed. It has the longer wings and more slender tail than continental goniopeltis, and usually has the broader black stripes along veins 4, 5 on the hindwing above. It is common in lowlands. Examples figured in PLATE 57-2, 3 are melanic aberrations. 57-2 has only faint spots on the underside; 57-3 is a unique form almost lacking series of submarginal red spots and also white spot in space 1c, while it has clearly defined white spots in spaces 2, 3 and 4. The individuals with the obsolescent submarginal red spots are numerous in brevicauda in Palawan, the melanic form as figured in PLATE 61-5 being not so rare. The extremely darkened examples as may be mistaken for atropos, the one of which is figured in PLATE 61-6, are rare and treated as the aberrant form.

Among the black aristolochiae the one with curious tails is brevicauda of Palawan. Brevicauda is a name of a form meaning 'short tailed', but in this book we adopted it as the subspecific name on the grounds that by this shape of the tail the examples from Palawan could be clearly separable from others. In Palawan, the proportion of the long-tailed form to the short tailed one varies according to season, but short-tailed forms (PLATE 57-8, 9, 10; PLATE61-5) are predominant. Such a form does not occur elsewhere in aristolochiae. Butterflies in flight are sometimes mistaken for black semperi. In Palawan they hardly frequent primeval forest, usually living on grasslands along forest edges. In the Malay Peninsula the white-patched asteris is distributed. It has the longer wings and more slender tail than continental goniopeltis, and usually has the broader black stripes along veins 4, 5 on the hindwing above. It is common in lowlands. Examples figured in PLATE 57-2, 3 are melanic aberrations. 57-2 has only faint spots on the underside; 57-3 is a unique form almost lacking series of submarginal red spots and also white spot in space 1c, while it has clearly defined white spots in spaces 2, 3 and 4. The individuals with the obsolescent submarginal red spots are numerous in brevicauda in Palawan, the melanic form as figured in PLATE 61-5 being not so rare. The extremely darkened examples as may be mistaken for atropos, the one of which is figured in PLATE 61-6, are rare and treated as the aberrant form. In Palawan the species, together with P. a cropos and A. semperi, tends to be darkened, the phenomenon sometimes being called insular melanism. It is of much interest that the black aristolochiae subspecies, such as antiphus and agricola, are widely distributed ranging from Borneo to Tanajampea. In Selayar, the nearest island just north of Tanajampea, there occurs polyphontes, the separate species, and in Flores, south of it, the peculiar white-patched subspecies occurs. The example from Tanajampea is here separated as ssp. agricola as it has differently shaped submarginal red spots on the hindwing beneath. The comparative study of the submarginal red spots of black aristolochiae subspecies reveals that they are large, rectangular but slightly rounded in Borneo, Sumatra and Nias, small and rounded as usual in Lesser Sunda in lombokensis from Lombok and very slender, particularly in the female which has them crescent-shaped, in agricola from Tanajampea. The white-patched aristolochiae similar to the Continental form is distributed in Java, Bawean and Kangean. Examples from Bawean are similar to those from Java though we have few of them. A fine melanic aberration with the white spots obsolescent above is figured in PLATE 58-6. As in this case there seems to remain some melanic factor in Java. In the Lesser Sunda Islands from Bali and eastwards, the species has the red (yellow) spots on the hindwing beneath small and rounded. Balina from Bali is most variable in the indication of white spots probably as the island lies between Java and Lomook, changing from the one similar to Javan adamas to the one nearest to lombokensis from Lombok. It has the outwardly placed black spot in the white area in space Ic, this character being considered to be related to that of Java. Lombokensis is a black form, while austrosundana of the neighbouring Sumbawa is white-patched without exception, but the patch is not developed, only three spots being indicated in spaces 2,3 and 4. It occurs in two forms, namely, the yellowspotted (wing), yellow body form, and the red spotted (wing), red body form, and it has the centrally placed, black spot in the pink or yellowish white area in space 1c of the hindwing, which is regarded as an important feature of the subspecies. It is local in Sumbawa. The subspecies of Flores lacks this black spot in the pink area in space 1c, and has the well-developed central white spots in spaces 2-5, the character being peculiar among the subspecies of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is not abundant in Flores. It has not been recorded from Sumba. Probably due to the competition with P. oreon it is rare, and curiously enough, only the yellow-spotted, yeBow body form has been collected. It is a black aristolochiae subspecies without the white patch. Various species of Aristolochia are known as the larval food plants. Butterflies fly slow and visit many kinds of flowers. They usually occur in sub-montane zone, being abundant near human habitation, for instance, around villages, wastelands beside farms and graveyards. Rarely they are found to suck water.

Upperside hindwing with subtornal area of space 2 obscurely dusted with yellow scale. The rest of wing entirely black and unmarked. Underside forewing, basally blackish brown, space 1c almost black, with whitish vein stripes from vein 2 to costa, the stripes extend to outer half of cell. Underside hindwing, with submarginal series of seven yellow spots in spaces 1-7. The yellow spots small, and rounded and not clearly defined for they are black-dusted. Abdomen, with lateral and ventral sides dull yellow, dorsal side black. Clypeus covered with black-tipped dull yellow hair. It is a unique subspecies instantly separable from other subspecies by the above features. It is collected only at Lewa, C. Sumba. There also occurs P. oreon. It is noteworthy that P. oreon has the red submarginal spots while this species has them yellow. Very few specimens have been recorded in spite of the several researches. P. oreon, the competitive species is rather common. It represents the most southeastern extension of the a ristolochiae 's range. In Sumbawa, which lies to the north of Sumba, the yellow-spotted, yellow body form is collected, but it has the central white patch on the hindwing without exception. The new subspecific name means wisdom. Description Pachliopta aristolochiae agricola ssp. nov.

The examples from Tanajampea are rather closely allied to Bornean antiphus as Bryk classified them. But such a distribution pattern as occurring limitedly in Borneo and Tanajampea is unexampled and the interpretation of the fact is very difficult. A careful study of the submarginal spots on the hindwing beneath revealed that there were difinite differences between antiphus from Borneo (and Sumatra) and examples from Tanajampea, and here we describe the latter as a separate new subspecies. Forewing similar to antiphus. Underside hindwing, submarginal red spots poorly indicated and narrow. The male has spot in space 5 obsolescent, spots in spaces 3, 4,6,7, very narrow except those in spaces I, 2. The female similar to the male, but with small, obsolescent red spot in space 5. Lunular spots in spaces 3, 4 chervon-shaped and peculiar. It is separable from antiphus which has red spots round or rectangular. The subspecific name means farmer.

Usually the white-patched group of a ristolochiae is abundant in sunny grassland or open forest in lowland, while the black group is nowhere numerous and hardly considered as prosperous though it selects the same environment in lowland as its habitat. Among the black aristolochiae the one with curious tails is brevicauda of Palawan. Brevicauda is a name of a form meaning 'short tailed', but in this book we adopted it as the subspecific name on the grounds that by this shape of the tail the examples from Palawan could be clearly separable from others. In Palawan, the proportion of the long-tailed form to the short tailed one varies according to season, but short-tailed forms (PLATE 57-8, 9, 10; PLATE61-5) are predominant. Such a form does not occur elsewhere in aristolochiae. Butterflies in flight are sometimes mistaken for black semperi. In Palawan they hardly frequent primeval forest, usually living on grasslands along forest edges. In the Malay Peninsula the white-patched asteris is distributed. It has the longer wings and more slender tail than continental goniopeltis, and usually has the broader black stripes along veins 4, 5 on the hindwing above. It is common in lowlands. Examples figured in PLATE 57-2, 3 are melanic aberrations. 57-2 has only faint spots on the underside; 57-3 is a unique form almost lacking series of submarginal red spots and also white spot in space 1c, while it has clearly defined white spots in spaces 2, 3 and 4. The individuals with the obsolescent submarginal red spots are numerous in brevicauda in Palawan, the melanic form as figured in PLATE 61-5 being not so rare. The extremely darkened examples as may be mistaken for atropos, the one of which is figured in PLATE 61-6, are rare and treated as the aberrant form. In Palawan the species, together with P. a cropos and A. semperi, tends to be darkened, the phenomenon sometimes being called insular melanism. It is of much interest that the black aristolochiae subspecies, such as antiphus and agricola, are widely distributed ranging from Borneo to Tanajampea. In Selayar, the nearest island just north of Tanajampea, there occurs polyphontes, the separate species, and in Flores, south of it, the peculiar white-patched subspecies occurs. The example from Tanajampea is here separated as ssp. agricola as it has differently shaped submarginal red spots on the hindwing beneath. The comparative study of the submarginal red spots of black aristolochiae subspecies reveals that they are large, rectangular but slightly rounded in Borneo, Sumatra and Nias, small and rounded as usual in Lesser Sunda in lombokensis from Lombok and very slender, particularly in the female which has them crescent-shaped, in agricola from Tanajampea. The white-patched aristolochiae similar to the Continental form is distributed in Java, Bawean and Kangean. Examples from Bawean are similar to those from Java though we have few of them. A fine melanic aberration with the white spots obsolescent above is figured in PLATE 58-6. As in this case there seems to remain some melanic factor in Java. In the Lesser Sunda Islands from Bali and eastwards, the species has the red (yellow) spots on the hindwing beneath small and rounded. Balina from Bali is most variable in the indication of white spots probably as the island lies between Java and Lomook, changing from the one similar to Javan adamas to the one nearest to lombokensis from Lombok. It has the outwardly placed black spot in the white area in space Ic, this character being considered to be related to that of Java. Lombokensis is a black form, while austrosundana of the neighbouring Sumbawa is white-patched without exception, but the patch is not developed, only three spots being indicated in spaces 2,3 and 4. It occurs in two forms, namely, the yellowspotted (wing), yellow body form, and the red spotted (wing), red body form, and it has the centrally placed, black spot in the pink or yellowish white area in space 1c of the hindwing, which is regarded as an important feature of the subspecies. It is local in Sumbawa. The subspecies of Flores lacks this black spot in the pink area in space 1c, and has the well-developed central white spots in spaces 2-5, the character being peculiar among the subspecies of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is not abundant in Flores. It has not been recorded from Sumba. Probably due to the competition with P. oreon it is rare, and curiously enough, only the yellow-spotted, yeBow body form has been collected. It is a black aristolochiae subspecies without the white patch. Various species of Aristolochia are known as the larval food plants. Butterflies fly slow and visit many kinds of flowers. They usually occur in sub-montane zone, being abundant near human habitation, for instance, around villages, wastelands beside farms and graveyards. Rarely they are found to suck water.

Underside forewing, basally blackish brown, space 1c almost black, with whitish vein stripes from vein 2 to costa, the stripes extend to outer half of cell. Underside hindwing, with submarginal series of seven yellow spots in spaces 1-7. The yellow spots small, and rounded and not clearly defined for they are black-dusted. Abdomen, with lateral and ventral sides dull yellow, dorsal side black. Clypeus covered with black-tipped dull yellow hair. It is a unique subspecies instantly separable from other subspecies by the above features. It is collected only at Lewa, C. Sumba. There also occurs P. oreon. It is noteworthy that P. oreon has the red submarginal spots while this species has them yellow. Very few specimens have been recorded in spite of the several researches. P. oreon, the competitive species is rather common. It represents the most southeastern extension of the a ristolochiae 's range. In Sumbawa, which lies to the north of Sumba, the yellow-spotted, yellow body form is collected, but it has the central white patch on the hindwing without exception.

The examples from Tanajampea are rather closely allied to Bornean antiphus as Bryk classified them. But such a distribution pattern as occurring limitedly in Borneo and Tanajampea is unexampled and the interpretation of the fact is very difficult. A careful study of the submarginal spots on the hindwing beneath revealed that there were difinite differences between antiphus from Borneo (and Sumatra) and examples from Tanajampea, and here we describe the latter as a separate new subspecies. Forewing similar to antiphus. Underside hindwing, submarginal red spots poorly indicated and narrow. The male has spot in space 5 obsolescent, spots in spaces 3, 4,6,7, very narrow except those in spaces I, 2. The female similar to the male, but with small, obsolescent red spot in space 5.

It is widely distributed from India to Formosa and southward to the Lesser Sunda Islands. The species being favoured with geographic variation, twenty subspecies are known up to now. Besides, it shows considerable individual variation, and in some subspecies two forms, namely, the form with red-spotted wing and red body, and the form with yellow-spotted wing and yellow body, occur together. In many localities it serves as a model of the female of P. polytes. We figure twelve subspecies out of the fifteen occurring in the area here dealt with. Camorta from Nicobar, aphrodite from Sabang and antissa from Kangean were not available and not figured in this book.

Besides, it shows considerable individual variation, and in some subspecies two forms, namely, the form with red-spotted wing and red body, and the form with yellow-spotted wing and yellow body, occur together. In many localities it serves as a model of the female of P. polytes. We figure twelve subspecies out of the fifteen occurring in the area here dealt with. Camorta from Nicobar, aphrodite from Sabang and antissa from Kangean were not available and not figured in this book. Almost in the center of its range, there lies the range of the black aristolochiae which lacks the central white patch on the hindwing. It occupies considerable area covering Palawan, Borneo, Sumatra, Nias, etc. No white-patched form has been known from the above districts, but in Java and Bali, the black forms are mixed in the white-patched forms. Usually the white-patched group of a ristolochiae is abundant in sunny grassland or open forest in lowland, while the black group is nowhere numerous and hardly considered as prosperous though it selects the same environment in lowland as its habitat. Among the black aristolochiae the one with curious tails is brevicauda of Palawan. Brevicauda is a name of a form meaning 'short tailed', but in this book we adopted it as the subspecific name on the grounds that by this shape of the tail the examples from Palawan could be clearly separable from others. In Palawan, the proportion of the long-tailed form to the short tailed one varies according to season, but short-tailed forms (PLATE 57-8, 9, 10; PLATE61-5) are predominant. Such a form does not occur elsewhere in aristolochiae. Butterflies in flight are sometimes mistaken for black semperi. In Palawan they hardly frequent primeval forest, usually living on grasslands along forest edges. In the Malay Peninsula the white-patched asteris is distributed. It has the longer wings and more slender tail than continental goniopeltis, and usually has the broader black stripes along veins 4, 5 on the hindwing above. It is common in lowlands. Examples figured in PLATE 57-2, 3 are melanic aberrations. 57-2 has only faint spots on the underside; 57-3 is a unique form almost lacking series of submarginal red spots and also white spot in space 1c, while it has clearly defined white spots in spaces 2, 3 and 4. The individuals with the obsolescent submarginal red spots are numerous in brevicauda in Palawan, the melanic form as figured in PLATE 61-5 being not so rare. The extremely darkened examples as may be mistaken for atropos, the one of which is figured in PLATE 61-6, are rare and treated as the aberrant form. In Palawan the species, together with P. a cropos and A. semperi, tends to be darkened, the phenomenon sometimes being called insular melanism. It is of much interest that the black aristolochiae subspecies, such as antiphus and agricola, are widely distributed ranging from Borneo to Tanajampea. In Selayar, the nearest island just north of Tanajampea, there occurs polyphontes, the separate species, and in Flores, south of it, the peculiar white-patched subspecies occurs. The example from Tanajampea is here separated as ssp. agricola as it has differently shaped submarginal red spots on the hindwing beneath. The comparative study of the submarginal red spots of black aristolochiae subspecies reveals that they are large, rectangular but slightly rounded in Borneo, Sumatra and Nias, small and rounded as usual in Lesser Sunda in lombokensis from Lombok and very slender, particularly in the female which has them crescent-shaped, in agricola from Tanajampea. The white-patched aristolochiae similar to the Continental form is distributed in Java, Bawean and Kangean. Examples from Bawean are similar to those from Java though we have few of them. A fine melanic aberration with the white spots obsolescent above is figured in PLATE 58-6. As in this case there seems to remain some melanic factor in Java. In the Lesser Sunda Islands from Bali and eastwards, the species has the red (yellow) spots on the hindwing beneath small and rounded. Balina from Bali is most variable in the indication of white spots probably as the island lies between Java and Lomook, changing from the one similar to Javan adamas to the one nearest to lombokensis from Lombok. It has the outwardly placed black spot in the white area in space Ic, this character being considered to be related to that of Java. Lombokensis is a black form, while austrosundana of the neighbouring Sumbawa is white-patched without exception, but the patch is not developed, only three spots being indicated in spaces 2,3 and 4. It occurs in two forms, namely, the yellowspotted (wing), yellow body form, and the red spotted (wing), red body form, and it has the centrally placed, black spot in the pink or yellowish white area in space 1c of the hindwing, which is regarded as an important feature of the subspecies. It is local in Sumbawa. The subspecies of Flores lacks this black spot in the pink area in space 1c, and has the well-developed central white spots in spaces 2-5, the character being peculiar among the subspecies of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is not abundant in Flores. It has not been recorded from Sumba. Probably due to the competition with P. oreon it is rare, and curiously enough, only the yellow-spotted, yeBow body form has been collected. It is a black aristolochiae subspecies without the white patch. Various species of Aristolochia are known as the larval food plants. Butterflies fly slow and visit many kinds of flowers. They usually occur in sub-montane zone, being abundant near human habitation, for instance, around villages, wastelands beside farms and graveyards. Rarely they are found to suck water.

Upperside hindwing with subtornal area of space 2 obscurely dusted with yellow scale. The rest of wing entirely black and unmarked. Underside forewing, basally blackish brown, space 1c almost black, with whitish vein stripes from vein 2 to costa, the stripes extend to outer half of cell. Underside hindwing, with submarginal series of seven yellow spots in spaces 1-7. The yellow spots small, and rounded and not clearly defined for they are black-dusted. Abdomen, with lateral and ventral sides dull yellow, dorsal side black. Clypeus covered with black-tipped dull yellow hair. It is a unique subspecies instantly separable from other subspecies by the above features. It is collected only at Lewa, C. Sumba. There also occurs P. oreon. It is noteworthy that P. oreon has the red submarginal spots while this species has them yellow. Very few specimens have been recorded in spite of the several researches. P. oreon, the competitive species is rather common. It represents the most southeastern extension of the a ristolochiae 's range. In Sumbawa, which lies to the north of Sumba, the yellow-spotted, yellow body form is collected, but it has the central white patch on the hindwing without exception. The new subspecific name means wisdom. Description Pachliopta aristolochiae agricola ssp. nov.

The examples from Tanajampea are rather closely allied to Bornean antiphus as Bryk classified them. But such a distribution pattern as occurring limitedly in Borneo and Tanajampea is unexampled and the interpretation of the fact is very difficult. A careful study of the submarginal spots on the hindwing beneath revealed that there were difinite differences between antiphus from Borneo (and Sumatra) and examples from Tanajampea, and here we describe the latter as a separate new subspecies. Forewing similar to antiphus. Underside hindwing, submarginal red spots poorly indicated and narrow. The male has spot in space 5 obsolescent, spots in spaces 3, 4,6,7, very narrow except those in spaces I, 2. The female similar to the male, but with small, obsolescent red spot in space 5. Lunular spots in spaces 3, 4 chervon-shaped and peculiar. It is separable from antiphus which has red spots round or rectangular. The subspecific name means farmer.

Vietnam (Metaye, 1957) and also noted from N. Vietnam and s. China (Bascombe et al., 1991). HABITAT AND BIOLOGY. In the north of the country the species occurs from April to September. The night period in C. Vietnam was observed from January (southern sites) and March to October and November. In the south it was recorded at all times of the year. The species is found in secondary vegetation and is attracted to Bowering bushes and herbs. It nies rather slowly and low, with night conducted by the FW and using the H W for balance. The larvae feed on Aristolochia spp. (Aristolochia tagala, A. indica, A. griffithi and A.fordiana) and adults are toxic to birds. SIMILAR SPECIES. Flying species may be confused with L. coon and some Byasa and with the female of Papilio polytes, though the last species has a black abdomen. ",B_16503

(Tsukada call.) agricola ssp. nov. (Tsukada call.) [Notes] This species is a member of the Aristolochiae group, in which kotzebuea, polyphontes and polydorus are also included. It is widely distributed from India to Formosa and southward to the Lesser Sunda Islands. The species being favoured with geographic variation, twenty subspecies are known up to now. Besides, it shows considerable individual variation, and in some subspecies two forms, namely, the form with red-spotted wing and red body, and the form with yellow-spotted wing and yellow body, occur together. In many localities it serves as a model of the female of P. polytes. We figure twelve subspecies out of the fifteen occurring in the area here dealt with. Camorta from Nicobar, aphrodite from Sabang and antissa from Kangean were not available and not figured in this book. Almost in the center of its range, there lies the range of the black aristolochiae which lacks the central white patch on the hindwing. It occupies considerable area covering Palawan, Borneo, Sumatra, Nias, etc. No white-patched form has been known from the above districts, but in Java and Bali, the black forms are mixed in the white-patched forms. Usually the white-patched group of a ristolochiae is abundant in sunny grassland or open forest in lowland, while the black group is nowhere numerous and hardly considered as prosperous though it selects the same environment in lowland as its habitat. Among the black aristolochiae the one with curious tails is brevicauda of Palawan. Brevicauda is a name of a form meaning 'short tailed', but in this book we adopted it as the subspecific name on the grounds that by this shape of the tail the examples from Palawan could be clearly separable from others. In Palawan, the proportion of the long-tailed form to the short tailed one varies according to season, but short-tailed forms (PLATE 57-8, 9, 10; PLATE61-5) are predominant. Such a form does not occur elsewhere in aristolochiae. Butterflies in flight are sometimes mistaken for black semperi. In Palawan they hardly frequent primeval forest, usually living on grasslands along forest edges. In the Malay Peninsula the white-patched asteris is distributed. It has the longer wings and more slender tail than continental goniopeltis, and usually has the broader black stripes along veins 4, 5 on the hindwing above. It is common in lowlands. Examples figured in PLATE 57-2, 3 are melanic aberrations. 57-2 has only faint spots on the underside; 57-3 is a unique form almost lacking series of submarginal red spots and also white spot in space 1c, while it has clearly defined white spots in spaces 2, 3 and 4. The individuals with the obsolescent submarginal red spots are numerous in brevicauda in Palawan, the melanic form as figured in PLATE 61-5 being not so rare. The extremely darkened examples as may be mistaken for atropos, the one of which is figured in PLATE 61-6, are rare and treated as the aberrant form. In Palawan the species, together with P. a cropos and A. semperi, tends to be darkened, the phenomenon sometimes being called insular melanism. It is of much interest that the black aristolochiae subspecies, such as antiphus and agricola, are widely distributed ranging from Borneo to Tanajampea. In Selayar, the nearest island just north of Tanajampea, there occurs polyphontes, the separate species, and in Flores, south of it, the peculiar white-patched subspecies occurs. The example from Tanajampea is here separated as ssp. agricola as it has differently shaped submarginal red spots on the hindwing beneath. The comparative study of the submarginal red spots of black aristolochiae subspecies reveals that they are large, rectangular but slightly rounded in Borneo, Sumatra and Nias, small and rounded as usual in Lesser Sunda in lombokensis from Lombok and very slender, particularly in the female which has them crescent-shaped, in agricola from Tanajampea. The white-patched aristolochiae similar to the Continental form is distributed in Java, Bawean and Kangean. Examples from Bawean are similar to those from Java though we have few of them. A fine melanic aberration with the white spots obsolescent above is figured in PLATE 58-6. As in this case there seems to remain some melanic factor in Java. In the Lesser Sunda Islands from Bali and eastwards, the species has the red (yellow) spots on the hindwing beneath small and rounded. Balina from Bali is most variable in the indication of white spots probably as the island lies between Java and Lomook, changing from the one similar to Javan adamas to the one nearest to lombokensis from Lombok. It has the outwardly placed black spot in the white area in space Ic, this character being considered to be related to that of Java. Lombokensis is a black form, while austrosundana of the neighbouring Sumbawa is white-patched without exception, but the patch is not developed, only three spots being indicated in spaces 2,3 and 4. It occurs in two forms, namely, the yellowspotted (wing), yellow body form, and the red spotted (wing), red body form, and it has the centrally placed, black spot in the pink or yellowish white area in space 1c of the hindwing, which is regarded as an important feature of the subspecies. It is local in Sumbawa. The subspecies of Flores lacks this black spot in the pink area in space 1c, and has the well-developed central white spots in spaces 2-5, the character being peculiar among the subspecies of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is not abundant in Flores. It has not been recorded from Sumba. Probably due to the competition with P. oreon it is rare, and curiously enough, only the yellow-spotted, yeBow body form has been collected. It is a black aristolochiae subspecies without the white patch. Various species of Aristolochia are known as the larval food plants. Butterflies fly slow and visit many kinds of flowers. They usually occur in sub-montane zone, being abundant near human habitation, for instance, around villages, wastelands beside farms and graveyards. Rarely they are found to suck water.

Upperside hindwing with subtornal area of space 2 obscurely dusted with yellow scale. The rest of wing entirely black and unmarked. Underside forewing, basally blackish brown, space 1c almost black, with whitish vein stripes from vein 2 to costa, the stripes extend to outer half of cell. Underside hindwing, with submarginal series of seven yellow spots in spaces 1-7. The yellow spots small, and rounded and not clearly defined for they are black-dusted. Abdomen, with lateral and ventral sides dull yellow, dorsal side black. Clypeus covered with black-tipped dull yellow hair. It is a unique subspecies instantly separable from other subspecies by the above features. It is collected only at Lewa, C. Sumba. There also occurs P. oreon. It is noteworthy that P. oreon has the red submarginal spots while this species has them yellow. Very few specimens have been recorded in spite of the several researches. P. oreon, the competitive species is rather common. It represents the most southeastern extension of the a ristolochiae 's range. In Sumbawa, which lies to the north of Sumba, the yellow-spotted, yellow body form is collected, but it has the central white patch on the hindwing without exception. The new subspecific name means wisdom. Description Pachliopta aristolochiae agricola ssp. nov.

The examples from Tanajampea are rather closely allied to Bornean antiphus as Bryk classified them. But such a distribution pattern as occurring limitedly in Borneo and Tanajampea is unexampled and the interpretation of the fact is very difficult. A careful study of the submarginal spots on the hindwing beneath revealed that there were difinite differences between antiphus from Borneo (and Sumatra) and examples from Tanajampea, and here we describe the latter as a separate new subspecies. Forewing similar to antiphus. Underside hindwing, submarginal red spots poorly indicated and narrow. The male has spot in space 5 obsolescent, spots in spaces 3, 4,6,7, very narrow except those in spaces I, 2. The female similar to the male, but with small, obsolescent red spot in space 5. Lunular spots in spaces 3, 4 chervon-shaped and peculiar. It is separable from antiphus which has red spots round or rectangular. The subspecific name means farmer.

(Tsukada call.) agricola ssp. nov. (Tsukada call.) [Notes] This species is a member of the Aristolochiae group, in which kotzebuea, polyphontes and polydorus are also included. It is widely distributed from India to Formosa and southward to the Lesser Sunda Islands. The species being favoured with geographic variation, twenty subspecies are known up to now. Besides, it shows considerable individual variation, and in some subspecies two forms, namely, the form with red-spotted wing and red body, and the form with yellow-spotted wing and yellow body, occur together. In many localities it serves as a model of the female of P. polytes. We figure twelve subspecies out of the fifteen occurring in the area here dealt with. Camorta from Nicobar, aphrodite from Sabang and antissa from Kangean were not available and not figured in this book. Almost in the center of its range, there lies the range of the black aristolochiae which lacks the central white patch on the hindwing. It occupies considerable area covering Palawan, Borneo, Sumatra, Nias, etc. No white-patched form has been known from the above districts, but in Java and Bali, the black forms are mixed in the white-patched forms. Usually the white-patched group of a ristolochiae is abundant in sunny grassland or open forest in lowland, while the black group is nowhere numerous and hardly considered as prosperous though it selects the same environment in lowland as its habitat. Among the black aristolochiae the one with curious tails is brevicauda of Palawan. Brevicauda is a name of a form meaning 'short tailed', but in this book we adopted it as the subspecific name on the grounds that by this shape of the tail the examples from Palawan could be clearly separable from others. In Palawan, the proportion of the long-tailed form to the short tailed one varies according to season, but short-tailed forms (PLATE 57-8, 9, 10; PLATE61-5) are predominant. Such a form does not occur elsewhere in aristolochiae. Butterflies in flight are sometimes mistaken for black semperi. In Palawan they hardly frequent primeval forest, usually living on grasslands along forest edges. In the Malay Peninsula the white-patched asteris is distributed. It has the longer wings and more slender tail than continental goniopeltis, and usually has the broader black stripes along veins 4, 5 on the hindwing above. It is common in lowlands. Examples figured in PLATE 57-2, 3 are melanic aberrations. 57-2 has only faint spots on the underside; 57-3 is a unique form almost lacking series of submarginal red spots and also white spot in space 1c, while it has clearly defined white spots in spaces 2, 3 and 4. The individuals with the obsolescent submarginal red spots are numerous in brevicauda in Palawan, the melanic form as figured in PLATE 61-5 being not so rare. The extremely darkened examples as may be mistaken for atropos, the one of which is figured in PLATE 61-6, are rare and treated as the aberrant form. In Palawan the species, together with P. a cropos and A. semperi, tends to be darkened, the phenomenon sometimes being called insular melanism. It is of much interest that the black aristolochiae subspecies, such as antiphus and agricola, are widely distributed ranging from Borneo to Tanajampea. In Selayar, the nearest island just north of Tanajampea, there occurs polyphontes, the separate species, and in Flores, south of it, the peculiar white-patched subspecies occurs. The example from Tanajampea is here separated as ssp. agricola as it has differently shaped submarginal red spots on the hindwing beneath. The comparative study of the submarginal red spots of black aristolochiae subspecies reveals that they are large, rectangular but slightly rounded in Borneo, Sumatra and Nias, small and rounded as usual in Lesser Sunda in lombokensis from Lombok and very slender, particularly in the female which has them crescent-shaped, in agricola from Tanajampea. The white-patched aristolochiae similar to the Continental form is distributed in Java, Bawean and Kangean. Examples from Bawean are similar to those from Java though we have few of them. A fine melanic aberration with the white spots obsolescent above is figured in PLATE 58-6. As in this case there seems to remain some melanic factor in Java. In the Lesser Sunda Islands from Bali and eastwards, the species has the red (yellow) spots on the hindwing beneath small and rounded. Balina from Bali is most variable in the indication of white spots probably as the island lies between Java and Lomook, changing from the one similar to Javan adamas to the one nearest to lombokensis from Lombok. It has the outwardly placed black spot in the white area in space Ic, this character being considered to be related to that of Java. Lombokensis is a black form, while austrosundana of the neighbouring Sumbawa is white-patched without exception, but the patch is not developed, only three spots being indicated in spaces 2,3 and 4. It occurs in two forms, namely, the yellowspotted (wing), yellow body form, and the red spotted (wing), red body form, and it has the centrally placed, black spot in the pink or yellowish white area in space 1c of the hindwing, which is regarded as an important feature of the subspecies. It is local in Sumbawa. The subspecies of Flores lacks this black spot in the pink area in space 1c, and has the well-developed central white spots in spaces 2-5, the character being peculiar among the subspecies of the Lesser Sunda Islands. It is not abundant in Flores. It has not been recorded from Sumba. Probably due to the competition with P. oreon it is rare, and curiously enough, only the yellow-spotted, yeBow body form has been collected. It is a black aristolochiae subspecies without the white patch. Various species of Aristolochia are known as the larval food plants. Butterflies fly slow and visit many kinds of flowers. They usually occur in sub-montane zone, being abundant near human habitation, for instance, around villages, wastelands beside farms and graveyards. Rarely they are found to suck water.

Upperside hindwing with subtornal area of space 2 obscurely dusted with yellow scale. The rest of wing entirely black and unmarked. Underside forewing, basally blackish brown, space 1c almost black, with whitish vein stripes from vein 2 to costa, the stripes extend to outer half of cell. Underside hindwing, with submarginal series of seven yellow spots in spaces 1-7. The yellow spots small, and rounded and not clearly defined for they are black-dusted. Abdomen, with lateral and ventral sides dull yellow, dorsal side black. Clypeus covered with black-tipped dull yellow hair. It is a unique subspecies instantly separable from other subspecies by the above features. It is collected only at Lewa, C. Sumba. There also occurs P. oreon. It is noteworthy that P. oreon has the red submarginal spots while this species has them yellow. Very few specimens have been recorded in spite of the several researches. P. oreon, the competitive species is rather common. It represents the most southeastern extension of the a ristolochiae 's range. In Sumbawa, which lies to the north of Sumba, the yellow-spotted, yellow body form is collected, but it has the central white patch on the hindwing without exception. The new subspecific name means wisdom. Description Pachliopta aristolochiae agricola ssp. nov. (PLATE 59-7.8) MALE : A illustrated FEMALE: A illustrated Range : Tanajampea Holotype: [male] Tanajampea South of CELEBES 1978-Mar.-14 Paratypes: Tanajampea South of CELEBES 1979-Mar.- 14 (2 [male] 1 [female]), 1979-Mar.-16 (1 [female]) The form of this species occurrring in Tanajampea has been classified as belonging to antiphus, the subspecies of Borneo and Sumatra, but the black aristolochiae subspecies proved to be two-stemmed, namely, antiphus, brevicauda stem from Palawan, Borneo, Sumatra and Nias, and balina, lombokensis and sapientia stem from Lesser Sunda. The examples from Tanajampea are rather closely allied to Bornean antiphus as Bryk classified them. But such a distribution pattern as occurring limitedly in Borneo and Tanajampea is unexampled and the interpretation of the fact is very difficult. A careful study of the submarginal spots on the hindwing beneath revealed that there were difinite differences between antiphus from Borneo (and Sumatra) and examples from Tanajampea, and here we describe the latter as a separate new subspecies. Forewing similar to antiphus. Underside hindwing, submarginal red spots poorly indicated and narrow. The male has spot in space 5 obsolescent, spots in spaces 3, 4,6,7, very narrow except those in spaces I, 2. The female similar to the male, but with small, obsolescent red spot in space 5. Lunular spots in spaces 3, 4 chervon-shaped and peculiar. It is separable from antiphus which has red spots round or rectangular. The subspecific name means farmer.

The examples from Tanajampea are rather closely allied to Bornean antiphus as Bryk classified them. But such a distribution pattern as occurring limitedly in Borneo and Tanajampea is unexampled and the interpretation of the fact is very difficult. A careful study of the submarginal spots on the hindwing beneath revealed that there were difinite differences between antiphus from Borneo (and Sumatra) and examples from Tanajampea, and here we describe the latter as a separate new subspecies. Forewing similar to antiphus. Underside hindwing, submarginal red spots poorly indicated and narrow. The male has spot in space 5 obsolescent, spots in spaces 3, 4,6,7, very narrow except those in spaces I, 2. The female similar to the male, but with small, obsolescent red spot in space 5. Lunular spots in spaces 3, 4 chervon-shaped and peculiar. It is separable from antiphus which has red spots round or rectangular. The subspecific name means farmer.

Polymorphism is characteristic for some representatives of the genera Chilasa and Papilio, but is seen mainly for Menelaides. The majority of polymorphic swallowtail species are the mimics of inedible taxa belonging to some Troidini: Byasa, Pachliopta and Losaria and some Danainae: Euploea and Parantica. Sometimes a mimic species shows similarity with several taxa belonging not only to different species but also to different genera. For example, seven forms of Chilasa clytia are mimics of some species of Euploea and Parant ica (Nymphalidae: Danai nae). Chilasa paradoxa produces some forms that are mimics of Euploea mulciber and E. radamanthus. The males of Papilio memnon (Plate 16) are known in one form which is a mimic of Troidini: Atrophaneura varuna (Plate 3) and A. a idoneus (Plate 4). The female of p. memnon has several tailed forms that are mimics of other members of the same tribe: Pachliopta aristolochiae and Losaria coon (Plate 7) while some tailless forms are mimics of Atrophaneura zaleucus (Plate 3). Inedible taxa of Troidini: Byasa, Atrophaneura, Pachliopta and Losaria are characterised by a more or less stable wing pattern. They usually have more than one mimic species belonging to different genera or families. For example Pachliopta aristolochiae and Losaria coon have mimics amongst polymorphic Papilio memnon and p. polytes and monomorphic p. bootes. Papilio memnon, p. protenor and p . alcmenor are mimics for the males of Atrophaneura varuna and A. aidoneus. The female of Papilio alcmenor is a mimic for both sexes of Byasa polyeuctes and B. dasarada. ",B_16503

It is a relict species of the Continental origin, presumably having the common ancestral species with xuthus and specialized with more plesiomorphous characters retained than others. P. xuthus is distributed from japan to Korea, E. China and S. China. From the mating of xuthus from Japan ([female]) x benguetanus ([male]), F, and F2 were obtained, and the examination of the genitalia also proved their similarity in features. On these grounds some authors regard it as a subspecies of xuthus instead of the independent species. Here we treat it as the distinct species on the grounds that its markings differ greatly from those of xuthus in both sexes. It is a relict species remained in the montane district of N. Luzon and unlike xuthus it shows no biological reaction such as seasonal variation. This species has the same distribution as P. chikae in N. Luzon. It has been collected as far north as N. Bontoc, being not found at the northern extremity of N. Luzon and eastwards as well as in the Batan Peninsula. On Mt. St. Tomas and Mt. Paoai, the most famous localities of this species, the butterflies occur in some number from March to June, where many individuals are found hill-topping in the fine morning. They begin to appear from around 7 a.m., being most vigorously on the wing from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., then decrease in number in the afternoon, when the area is mostly covered by fog. If favoured with fine weather the species is found soaring on the wind together with Parantica phyle, Appias phoebe, ulastrina or Bestina spp. and Argyreus hyperbius. The flight of this species resembles that of the spring brood of xuthus in Japan. The butterflies fly swift on the breeze, prefer hill-tops and usually display territorial behaviour even on the small peak, with their figures in flight perceptible at some distance. Parantica phyle, which is considered to be the model of this species is abundant in St. Tomas, but is it hardly mistaken for this species as its flight is slow. A species of Bestina is rather similar to this species when on the wing. The female is scarcer than the male, but it is also obtainable on hill-tops. The sex is easily separable from the male by its larger size, well-developed submarginal orange-red spots on the hindwing and broader and paler black streaks on both wings. It resembles xuthus but its discrimination is very easy as it has a somewhat box-like wing contour and also has a very broad black streaks in the apical half of the forewing. The larval food plant in the field is unknown. The mother butterfly refused to lay egg on species of Zanthoxylum or Citrus brought from japan for some unknown reason, and nobody succeeded in obtaining eggs. It is only reported that the larva hatched from the eggs obtained artificially from the female body ate Phellodendron amurense. Subspeciation and seasonal or individual variations are not recognized till now. Presumably it is not a mimetic species, its resemblance to P. phyle being a coincidental one. Anyone can collect this species when it does occur abundantly. We have never seen the form similar to the summer brood of xuthus in japan.

P.apollo Linnaeus 1758TL: Sweden. DISTRIBUTION Most larger mountain ranges from Spain to S Fennoscandia, Balkans and Greece, including NW Pelopon nesus. Absent from British Isles and Mediterranean islands except Sicily. Extinct in C Germany, Denmark and Czech Republic. 500-2400m: generally above 1000m in S Europe. DESCRIPTION Male upf without red pd spot in s8; black pd spot in s5 rarely with obscure red centre: equivalent mark ings in female variable but averagely slightly better developed - sometimes conspicuous. Antennal shaft pale grey, narrowly ringed darker grey (cf. P.phnebiis). VARIATION A large accumulation of formal descriptions has resulted from attempts to account for local/regional variation in size, gc and development of markings. Many named forms differ only slightly, falling within an overall range of variation which might he considered normal for other species attracting less attention. An extensive, and therefore disproportionate account of racial differences may serve only to mislead. Amongst the more superficially distinctive forms are colour variants occurring at S\V and SE extremes of European range; in S Spain, iwraclensis Oberthiir (Sierra Nevada), jilaAr/cnv de Sagarra (S. de los Filahres) and ^adoreitsis Rougeot and Capdeville (S. de Gador); all red markings replaced by yellow-orange: in S Greece (Mt. Erimanthos. NW Peloponnesus), alrides van Apollo der Poorten and Oils: similarly coloured. Other races of Spain {liispankiis Oberthiir), Greece and S Balkans {rhmlopensis Markovic) have the more usual red markings. FLIGHT-PERIDD Univoltine. Early May/September according to locality, altitude and .season. HABITAT Breeding-grounds comprise rocky places with areas favouring the establishment of LHP (Sedum) and the gen eral exclusion of plant species requiring a more substantial soil-base - a condition met partly by the relatively high tolerance of LHP to desiccating conditions. Well-drained, often precipitous rocky slopes; limestone pavements with narrow crevices or hollows, or other flat, stony surfaces provide typical habitats where these occur in proximity to deeper soils supporting robust nectar-rich plants such as knapweeds and thistles. LtFE-HtSTDRY LHPs principally Sedum album: less often, S. lelcphium. Other Sedum spp. and allied genera arc often quoted in the literature - S. yoseunp S. aimuum: S. villosum: Sempermum leelorum; Rhodiola rnsea. Ova laid on dead or living woody plant stems, and the leaves of evergreen shrubs such as juniper or lichens. Usually hibernates as a fully formed larva within ovum-case, less often externally: may remain in diapause for two seasonal cycles: feeds in full sun on leaves. Larva, velvety black, lateral spots yellow or brilliant orange-red according to locality. Pupates in a flimsy cocoon under stones or moss. NOTE Declined rapidly in Germany, Norway, Sweden and parts of France during the present century: climatic change appears primarily responsible. ",B_16599

The apollo is easy to recognise and impossible to confuse with other Finnish species. It can be easily differentiated from the clouded apollo by the red ring patterns on its hind wings.  Males fly around looking for females. Copulated females have at the back of their bodies, a shell-like structure called a sfragis.

It is often seen in city parks, gardens, and urban vacant lots, as well as in rural areas. Males are territorial and typically perch well off the ground, up to waist height. They perform spectacular aerial male-male chases, typically returning to their previous perches by executing a wide circle near human eye level. Males flash bluish in flight. Females usually fly close to the ground and lack the bluish sheen. Both sexes visit a great variety of flowers, with mints (Mentha)y including garden lavender (Lrtvandw/nJ, and birdfoot trefoil (Lotus cornicuiatus) among their favorites. The Common Checkered Skipper seems to have benefited from the human transformation of lowland Californian land scapes and vegetation. Our populations are multivoltine. Assum ing they were multivoltine before Europeans came, they had to have been restricted to a handfiil of native host plants whose seasonality would support multiple broods: alkali mallow (Malvella leprosa) in alkaline clay soils in the Central Valley, and various species of checkerbloom (Sidalcea) in tule marshes and moist meadows. These are still used, but the vast majority of eggs can be found today on the introduced weedy mallows (Malva) in dis turbed habitats. It seems certain that the Common Checkered Skipper must be much more abundant now than it could have been 200 years ago. From the Transverse Ranges southward throughout southern California, the Common Checkered Skipper is replaced by an an imal called the White Checkered Skipper (P. albescens). The com mon and scientific names are both deceptive, because the White on average is no whiter than the Common; in fact, the two are re liably distinguishable only by the male genitalia. (See John M. Burns, ''Pyrgus communis and Pyrgus albescens are separate transcontinental species with variable but diagnostic valves,"" Journal of the I^pidopterists Society 54:52-71,2000.) Their biol ogy is also identical. Only a few individuals with albescens geni talia have been detected north of the Transverse Ranges—aU south of our area. Are these really good species? Molecular studies, still in progress at this writing, present a confusing picture. At the mo lecular level, southern California White Checkered Skippers are consistently different from northern California Common Check ered Skippers—except in the Sierra Nevada. Sierran genitalic Commons (from above 1,200 m [4,000 ft]) are univoltine and feed only on native checkerbloom (Sidalcea), often on the floor of open coniferous forest, sometimes on meadows. Molecularly, these are White Checkered Skippers.'Along the Sierran east slope and in the western Great Basin are multivoltine populations feed ing on weedy mallows, and these are indistinguishable from our Commons. There thus appear to be three entities: multivoltine low-elevation and Great Basin morphological and molecular P. communis; multivoltine southern Californian morphological and molecular P. albescens; and Sierran univoltine, morphological P. communis-molecular P. albescens. Clearly, there is a great deal we do not understand about these critters. We know, thanks to Burns, that the White Checkered Skipper has expanded its range eastward all the way to the Adantic coast in recent decades; it shows up abruptly in collections at specific times. It is possible that it is also moving into lowland northern California! Because the species is considered so ubiquitous, this could easily slip under our radar. No one is seriously suggesting that the genitalia of every male in our area be checked, but users of this book should keep in mind the possibility of a White Checkered Skipper invasion and—if so inclined—take a peek at the form of the valves from time to time (see Burns' article for drawings). DISTRIBUTION: AU counties, everywhere except deep shade. HOST PLANTS: Herbaceous maUows (Malvaceae), including alkali maUow (Malvella leprosaf checkerblooms (Sidalcea), garden hoUyhocks (Akea), and aU species of the weedy mallows (Malvaf for example the cheeseweeds (M. neglecta, M. nicaeensis^ and M. parviflora). The use of velvet leaf (Abutilon theophrasti) also caUed Indian mallow, in our area needs to be confirmed. In the Sacramento area, now using the introduced lawn and golf course weed Modiola caroliniana. Eggs often laid on prostrate maUows in mowed lawns, seemingly in preference to taU, robust speci mens of the same species. Larva in a roUed-leaf nest, resting in a fishhook posture, apple green to purplish brown, with a dark line down the back and a very dark, blackish brown head. Hibernates as part-grown larva, usually pupating in the last larval nest. Pupa buff with brown markings, attached by the cremaster. SEASONS: Continuous broods February to November (rarely December). SIMILAR SPECIES: See discussion for White Checkered Skipper, not known in our area. The Two-banded Skipper (P ruralis), is about 75 percent the size of an average Common Checkered Skipper, with a distinctly grizzled look, no blue sheen, and a complex reddish ventral hindwing pattern; it is very local with the host (Horkelia), in moist habitats near the coast. The Least Checkered Skipper (P. scriptura) is 65 percent (early spring) to only 50 percent the size of the Common; it has more black in the wing pattern, especially in summer broods where white above may be reduced to small dots; the underside hindwing pattern is grayish and different in detail from that of the Common (see pi. 28). It prefers hot inland areas, often alkaline, with aUcaU mal low. Both species may co-occur with the Common Checkered Skipper. The Northern White Skipper (Heliopetes ericetorum) averages 115 percent the size of the Common Checkered Skipper; the male has the upper surface nearly all white except near the margins; the female has a checkered pattern that is incomplete in the middle of the wings; the underside of the hindwing has a wavy brown line in the middle and is not checkered. It is found in sunny, open country, especially chaparral, and is scarce.",B_3845

The majority of the species are found in the tropics, and about 30% of all species of butterflies in the world belong to this family. The adults are small to medium-sized butterflies. Most species are some shade of iridescent blue or purple on the uppers idc of the wings, with various patterns and colors on the underside. Despite their common group name, the ""Blues"", many species have no blue, but are varying shades of red, orange, brown or black.  Distinguishing characters: Members of this family are distinguished by the following characters in the adult: The antennae are set close together on top of the head and the eyes are large and close together. Many species have eyespots on the underside of the hindwing and hair-like tails. In the male, the front legs are reduced in most species. In the forewing, the radial vein has only 3 or 4 of the 5 branches (usually R3 and R4 are missing). The hindwing usually has two anal veins, but no humeral vein. A typical Lycaenid wing venation is illustrated in Fig. 6-1. Adult behavior: The adults are generally moderate to strong fliers despite their small size though some species have a weak, fluttering flight. Most species feed on the nectar of flowers; others feed on fruit, tree sap or decaying matter. Several species mudsip. They are generally found in open sunny places though some species are forest or canopy dwellers. Many species have tornal spots and tails on the hindwing; at rest, they sit head-down and move their hindwings rhythmically so that the tornal spots and tails imitate the head of an adult butterfly when viewed from the side. A predator that is deceived by the false head and attacks it would be rewarded with only a mouthful of wing. Some species have additional lobing on the hindwing, and when these individuals are viewed from behind, they too present a false head with eyes and antennae.  Immature stages: The egg is usually a smooth or a pitted flattened dome though in some species, the egg is almost spherical. The color ranges from white to cream to orange. The larva is usually flattened and slug-like (onisciform), triangular in cross-section, and with a small retractable head. The larvae of many Lycaenids are associated with ants and these have three specialized organs to interact with them: a single dorsal nectar organ (DNO) on segment A7, a pair of tentacle organs (TO) on segment AS and minute pore cupola organs (PCO) distributed over the dorsal surface of the body (Figs. 6-3a, b). The DNO is a complex structure, consisting of four glandular cells below the skin that secrete a mixture of sugars and amino acids into a central sac. When it chooses, the larva releases a drop of this mixture to the surface. These secretions are used as a source of food by the ants associated with the larva. The TO consists of an eversible tentacle with fine filaments at its tip (Fig. 6-5b). 1his structure produces substances that affect the behavior of the associated ants, particularly when the larva is threatened or is on the move. The PCOs are single-celled epidermal glands that secrete substances that are attractive to ants. Two types of ant-larval associations have been recognized among the Lycaenidae. Obligate myrmecophiles (""ant-lovers"") are those species in which the larva requires the presence of ants for their survival. In many species that belong to this category, the larva is susceptible to fungal diseases if the sugar secretions are not removed from the DNO by the ants. Further, the female of many species will not lay eggs unless the correct species of ant is present on the larval food plant. Facultative myrmecophiles are butterfly species whose larvae can survive without the presence of ants though they are often attended by ants. The larvae of some species live within an ant nest. The pupa is usually short and rounded with a girdle around the middle and is usually attached to the larval food plant with a pad of silk to which the anal hooks attach; it has no cremaster. In those species without a girdle, the pupa is usually positioned at an angle to the substrate or is suspended with its head down. Many species pupate in crevices or a centimeter or so under the soil or under leaf detritus on the ground. Some pupae, like the larvae, have PCOs and remain attended by ants. The larvae of many species feed on leaves, but some feed on the reproductive parts of flowers, or on fruits or seeds. Many plant families are used including the Leguminosae, Sapindaceae, Oipterocarpaceae, Primulaceae, Zingiberaceae and Rhamnaceae. The larva of one species in Sri Lanka, the Apefly (Spalgis epeus), is carnivorous and feeds on mealybugs (Insecta : Pseudococcidae). The immature stages of 22 species of Lycaenids and their larval food plants were documented in van der Poorten & van der Poorten (20 12b, 20 13b), 18 of them for the first time. Many of the other species have previously been described, though mostly from Indian material. The immature stages and larval food plants of the Tamil Oakblue (Arhopala bazaloides lanka) were described in error in van der Poorten & van der Poorten (2013b) as those of Ormiston's Oakblue (Arhopala ormistoni), whose immature stages are still unknown. As of this writing, the immature stages and larval food plants of several other species are still not known in Sri Lanka: Hampson's Hedge Blue (Acytolepis lilacea moorei), Plain Hedge Blue ( Celastrina lavendularis lavendularis), Pointed Lineblue (Jonolyce helicon viola), White-tipped Lineblue (Prosotas noreia noreia), White Hedge Blue ( Udara akasa mavisa), Singalese Hedge Blue ( Udara singalensis), Clouded Silverline (Spindasis nubilus), Plumbeous Silverline (Spindasis schistacea), Indian Red Flash (Rapala iarbus sorya), Malabar Flash (Rapala lankana), Common Onyx (Horaga onyx cingalensis), Brown Onyx (Horaga albimacula viola), and Ceylon Indigo Royal (Tajuria arida). In this publication, the immature stages and larval food plants of the following species in Sri Lanka are described for the first time from our records unless indicated otherwise: Silver Forgetme-not ( Catochrysops panormus lithargyria); Opaque 6-Lineblue (Nacaduba beroe minima) (T.S. Priyadarshana, pers. comm. and S. Sanjeewa, pers. comm.); Dark Ceylon 6-Lineblue (Nacaduba calauria toxopeusi) (S. Sanjeewa, pers. comm. and H. D. Jayasinghe, pers. comm.); Woodhouse's 4-Lineblue (Nacaduba ollyetti) (in part, H.D. Jayasinghe, pers. comm.); Dingy Lineblue (Petrelaea dana) (T. Ranasinghe, pers. comm.); Long-banded Silverline (Spindasis lohita lazularis) (T. Ranasinghe, pers. comm.); and Indigo Flash (Rapala varuna Lazulina) (T. Ranasinghe, pers. comm.). The immature stages and larval food plants of the following species have been confirmed and are presented in this publication: Transparent 6-Lineblue (Nacaduba kurava prominens) (H.D. Jayasinghe, pers. comm.).  Taxonomy: The Lycaenidae are classified under eight subfamilies of which four are represented in Sri Lanka: Curetinae (1 species), Miletinae (1 species), Polyommatinae (48 species including 6 endemic species and 9 endemic subspecies under 27 genera) and Theclinae (35 species including 4 endemic species and 12 endemic subspecies under 18 genera). These 85 species represent 35% of the butterfly fauna of Sri Lanka. Information about each subfamily is given in the text preceding the accounts of the species in that subfamily.  Conservation issues: In the National Red List 2012, 41 species of Lycaenidae are classified as LC (Least Concern). Twelve species are classified as CR (Critical), while 12 are classified as EN (Endangered), 10 as VU (Vulnerable), 4 as NT (Near Threatened) and 5 as DO (Data Deficient). One species, Arhopala bazaloides Lanka, was not included in the list as its existence in Sri Lanka was not confirmed at the time of the report. [images] Fig. 6·1. Wing venation. Lycaenidae.

In PNG, the race canonicus represents trebellius throughout the mainland and on the islands of Karkar (MgP), Umboi (MoP), Goodenough and Fergusson (MBP). The species appears to be absent in the Bismarcks. Ssp. sheba represents trebellius on Bougainville (NSP) and also throughout the Solomons. T trebellius is generally and locally common; 0-1,200 m in areas of open secondary vegetation along roads, foot tracks, creeks, and in old garden regrowth areas. Adults (PI. 2.37-39). [male] Av. 19/37. [female] Av. 23/42. Tagiades japetus is similar to trebellius (see T japetus, Adults). T nestus is harder to distinguish from trebellius. The 2 species are best separated by the distinct differences in the valvae of their male genitalia (compare in PI. II). In trebellius the valva is deeply divided so that its distal end is almost V-shaped, whereas in nestus the valva is shallowly divided and has a more U-shaped distal margin. The apex of the valva in trebellius is long and spine-like, whereas that of nestus is short and broadly serrate. A useful visual guide to the identification of [males], and especially [females], of trebellius and nestus is as follows. In trebellius the 2 HW und subapical black spots, between veins R5 and Mj, and M2, are always more or less traceable on the dark brown costal band. The spot between veins and M2 is rather nearer to the junction of these veins than the termen. In nestus the upper spot, between veins R5 and M1? is generally untraceable and the lower spot, between veins and M2, is always nearer to the termen than to the junction of these veins. Both trebellius and nestus vary throughout PNG in the extent of the HW upp white area (see PI. 2). On Bougainville (NSP), and throughout most of the Solomons, the race sheba is characterised by its much reduced white HW patch, which usually forms a band only 1 -2 mm wide, and the coalescence of the black spots to form a broad border. On the HW und the distal spots connect with the outer dark area. Therefore, this race resembles a number of the darker races (or forms) of nestus which appear to be prevalent throughout the islands of the Bismarcks, Trobriands, D’Entrecasteaux Group and Louisiades in PNG. Early Stages Those of ssp. martinus Plotz, 1884, in Japan were illustrated in colour by Shirozu and Hara (1960-62). In PNG, the early stages are as follows: Egg Pearly-white with 16 vertical ribs, almost spherical, but basally flattened. Larva Final instar (PI. 105.2949 and 2950) similar to that of japetus described above, but body paler turquoise-green. Pupa (PI. 105.2951) similar in shape to japetus but uniform pinkish-yellow or pale transluscent green, lacking markings. Foodplants Dioscorea allata (wild yam, Dioscoreaceae), a twining vine, which is also the foodplant of trebellius in Japan, according to Shirozu and Hara (1960-62). Habits Very similar to those of Tagiades japetus (see T japetus, Habits). Notes Near Bulolo (MoP) trebellius suffers frequent mortality at the pupal stage from the parasitoid wasp Brachymeria lasus (Chalcididae). A characteristic large round exit hole is left in the exuvium by the emerging adult wasp.",B_4243

It is possible that the northern populations belong to the nominate subspecies while the specimens collected in Ngoe Linh show similarity to the  ssp. gillesi. However the material so far collected is insufficient for confirmation.  HABITAT AND BIOLOGY. The males generally occupy summits or ridges above 2000 m, which they patrol, often choosing the tree tops to rest. In Ngoe Linh N.R. at  2,400 m the butterflies’ activity time is from 8.30-9.00 a.m. to 12.00-13.00 midday. Haribal (1992) notes: the males patrolling their territory have a rest “...they sit with their wings wide open or half open often motionless: they do not even respond to human touch. The males visit damp patches and also suck moisture from leaves. As soon as it becomes cloudy they stop all activity. The females are also seen flying to the summits and these are mostly virgins in search of males. The females fly on cloudy days as well as during showers and they also like sunny spells. Flight is very fast and flitting. They rarely visit flowers or damp patches...” According to Igarashi (1987) females lay eggs on the upper surface of the leaves of Magnolia campbelii (Magnoliaceae). Larvae prefer young leaves. Even though the eggs are laid on mature leaves larvae move and feed on the young  purple leaves. It keeps to the upperside of the leaves and when not feeding it rest on a silk pad spun on the leaf. It avoids direct sun light. The duration of the larval stage is about 50 days. In Ngoe Linh females were collected within montane riverine forest at 1,700 m.  SIMILAR SPECIES. Teinopalpus aureus: in the male the golden discal patch on the UpH covers approximately 1/2 of the cell; in the female the discal line on the HW is  curved inwardly at the basal area.

The males visit damp patches and also suck moisture from leaves. As soon as it becomes cloudy they stop all activity. The females are also seen flying to the summits and these are mostly virgins in search of males. The females fly on cloudy days as well as during showers and they also like sunny spells. Flight is very fast and flitting. They rarely visit flowers or damp patches...” According to Igarashi (1987) females lay eggs on the upper surface of the leaves of Magnolia campbelii (Magnoliaceae). Larvae prefer young leaves. Even though the eggs are laid on mature leaves larvae move and feed on the young  purple leaves. It keeps to the upperside of the leaves and when not feeding it rest on a silk pad spun on the leaf. It avoids direct sun light. The duration of the larval stage is about 50 days. In Ngoe Linh females were collected within montane riverine forest at 1,700 m.  SIMILAR SPECIES.

",,,,,NA,No,,Micael.Itliong,Lohman Lab,01/22/2019 - 20:41,01/22/2019 - 20:41,,"Subfamily ITHOMIINAE Kirby, 1894 Genus TELLERVO Kirby, 1894 According to the cladistic revision by Ackery (1987a), the Old World section of this nymphalid subfamily contains only 6 tailless species in a single genus, Tellervo Kirby, 1894. D’Abrera (1978) recognised 7 species. Common and Waterhouse (1981) referred to Tellervo as monotypic, containing only the supposedly very variable T zoilus. The genus is centred on the Australian Subregion and ranges from Ambon, Seram, Kai and Aru, eastwards throughout mainland NG, to the Bismarcks, Solomons and the Cape York Peninsula of Queensland in northern Australia. These fairly small butterflies have been popularly included (together with their many South American relatives) in the subfamily Ithomiinae, a taxon accorded the rank of a family by many authors and which was estimated by Ehrlich and Raven (1964) to contain from 300-400 species in 30-40 genera. However, Ehrlich (1958a) nomenclatorially downgraded Fox’s (1956) revision of the Tthomiidae’ to arrive at 2 tribes under the Ithomiinae: Tellervini and Ithomiini. This arrangement is considered here to be correct as the characters of the larvae and pupae of Tellervo, including their larval foodplant relations, clearly demonstrate that this group of nymphalids has very close affinities with the Neotropical Ithomiinae (see especially colour plates in Brown and Freitas, 1994). In addition to this, the treatment of Tellervo within the Ithomiinae is in keeping with the overall ‘balance’ of classification of the Nymphalidae (and other butterfly families) adopted here, as well as nomenclatorially emphasising (rather than obscuring) its closest relatives. The latter is most important in any consideration of the biogeographical origins of Tellervo (see Chapter 4). Noting that the Danainae + Ithomiinae obviously form a monophyletic group, Scott (1985) suggested that they are best treated as a single subfamily. Scott’s suggestion may yet prove to be the most ‘realistic’ level of classification for these nymphalids in comparison with the taxonomic divisions of other butterfly families. In spite of Ehrlich’s and Scott’s above-mentioned findings, Ackery and Vane-Wright (1984: 17, 61) stated that they could not recognise the sister-species group of the Danainae amongst the Ithomiini and Tellervini. They followed several other authors, including Forbes (1939) and Clark (1948), in treating Tellervo in its own subfamily, Tellervinae, equal in rank to Ithomiinae and Danainae. A number of early authors (e.g. van Eecke, 1914) referred to Tellervo under the subfamily name Palaeotropinae Haase, 1891, which is invalid, not being based on a valid included genus. Hamadryadinae Reuter, 1896, as a family-group name, is rendered invalid by Hamadryas Boisduval, 1832, being a junior homonym of Hamadryas Hubner, 1806. On the basis of a careful study of the early stages and larval habits of T zoilus, Okayama (1914) concluded that Tellervo represented a primitive subfamily of the ‘Danaidae’, and that the ‘Satyridae’ must, therefore, be more distantly related than previously indicated from a study of Tellervo adults alone. Forbes (1939) suggested that the Danainae and Satyrinae were “alike” as groups. Fox (1956) maintained that the Tthomiidae’ are closely related to the Satyrinae, and Miller (1968: 131) agreed that they “are not far removed from the satyrid complex”. However, based on a study of the early stages and behavioural ecology of the 2 subfamilies by Gilbert and Ehrlich (1970), Miller’s view of the supposed close relationship of Danainae and Satyrinae was shown to be erroneous. As outlined above, the closest relatives of Tellervo are the Ithomiinae and Danainae and the 3 groups clearly constitute a monophyletic unit. The most recent study of Ithomiinae by Brown and Freitas (1994) also suggests this. They found Tellervo to be phylogenetically 1 of the earliest (and thus most primitive) ithomiines. The work is notable for its colour photographic depiction of most of the mature larvae and pupae of 66 species in 40 out of the 53 genera of the Neotropical Ithomiinae, plus line-drawing figures of their eggs. The type species for Tellervo is zoilus (Fabricius, 1775), designated by author. The species was treated by a number of early authors under the genus Hamadryas Boisduval, 1832, but this name was preoccupied by Hamadryas Hubner, 1806, which applies to a large group of Neotropical nymphalines. In a study of Tellervo, Strand (1911c) treated the 4 species known at the time as races of zoilus. Joicey and Talbot (1922d) later described a distinctive new species, T jurriaansei, from the Menoo River and Mount Kunupi in the Weyland Mountains of Irian Jaya, which has pale yellowish hindwing patches (instead of the usual white of the genus). They also described 4 new subspecies of 2 other species. One of these, T parvipuncta, from Numfoor, Supiori, and Biak (Korrido) in the Schouten Islands group of Irian Jaya, was later treated by D’Abrera (1978) as a distinct species. T jurriaansei and T parvipuncta are the only 2 of the 6 Tellervo species which do not occur in PNG, apparently being endemic to Irian Jaya. Ackery (1987a) found that T jurriaansei was the most distinctive species of its genus in many characters, including its wing colour and pattern, venation, male genitalia and certain abdominal scales. Ackery and Vane-Wright (1984) stated that Tellervo is characterised by the lack of a dorsal hair-pencil (scent tuft) on hindwing vein Rs that is present in the ithomiine males, and by the lack of a pair of eversible abdominal hair-pencils (which are often associated with a hindwing pocket, or scent-pouch), present in Danainae. Instead, some Tellervo males bear a large diffuse (hardly distinguishable) sex-brand of androconial scales that extends across almost half of the forewing, from the inner margin (first described by de Niceville and Kuhn, 1898). Ehrlich (1958a) stated that the apical segment of the labial palpus in Tellervo is much longer than half the length of the second segment, whereas it is much shorter than half the length of the second segment in Ithomiinae. However, Fox (1956) stated that the Tellervo labial palpus is closely appressed to the head, the second segment being longest and curved, and the first segment one-fourth, and the third segment one-fifth, of the length of the second. Thus, Ackery (1987a) cautioned that the character states for Tellervo and the ithomiines were apparently transposed in Ehrlich’s study. Ackery (1987a) pointed out that, according to the 10 Ithomiinae + Tellervinae + Danainae larval tubercle formulae known at that time, only Tellervo bears a pair of dorsolateral tubercles on the metathoracic segment, and that this may be the best character by which Tellervinae may be defined, as Tellervo itself remains barely characterisable in terms of autapomorphies. In Ithomiinae the pair of dorsolateral tubercles, when present, are on the mesothoracic segment. However, Ackery also suggested that the white testes, as yet confirmed only for T zoilus by Emmel et al. (1974), may also eventually prove useful. Harvey (1991) pointed out, however, that an apparently unique apomorphic character that supports the monophyly of this group is the absence of filiform setae on the mature larval meso- and metathorax of Danaus (Danainae) and Tithorea (Ithomiinae), whereas in all other Nymphalidae these setae (of possibly sound-receptive function) are present on both segments (albeit not in full complements, except in Nymphalini and Melitaeni). However, Harvey was not able to study Tellervo and suggested that its filiform setal configuration would help resolve the relationship of Tellervo with the Danainae/Ithomiinae. It is confirmed here that the filiform setal configuration (i.e. pairs present in the normal positions on the prothorax, but absent on the meso- and metathoracic segments) in mature larval Tellervo, as well as in Euploea (pers. obs.), is as Harvey observed in Danaus and Tithorea. This supports Harvey’s suggestion that Danainae/Ithomiinae are a monophyletic group. Okayama (1914) pointed out that the pupa, apart from some black spots, is entirely yellow [or pale green] and lacks any of the metallic gold (or silver) ornamentation typical of danaine pupae, especially those of Euploea. In a study of the chromosomes of T. zoilus Emmel et al. (1974) suggested that its haploid number (n) of n = 32 is particularly interesting because it differs radically from the usual karyotypic numbers for the New World ithomiines, of which the majority fall between n = 11 and n = 27 (with only a few species at n = 31, 41, 45 or 48). Two of the chromosome pairs are notably larger than the remainder and possibly represent the 2 X sex chromosomes present in all male Lepidoptera. As in the New World ithomiines, the Tellervo antenna is scaled, whereas it is unsealed in the Danainae. The eye is smooth and, interestingly, is bright yellow in life. The female forelegs have a 5-segmented tarsus. Forewing vein 3A is present, but anastomoses subbasally with vein 1A+2A. The cells of both wings are closed by tubular discocellular veins. The forewing bears a short recurrent veinlet (vestigial in T. jurriaansei). The male genitalia (PI. XVI) are simple and a gnathos is present, the brachia of which are spiniform. Ackery and Vane-Wright (1984) suggested that, besides their morphological characters, probably a good character to establish the grouping of Ithomiinae + Tellervinae + Danainae will prove to be their use of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). Males of both the Ithomiinae and Danainae are known to be attracted to PA- containing plants (Pliske et al., 1976). These are necessary in the production of danaidone and similar pheromones used in courtship of their females (e.g. Pliske and Eisner, 1969; Pliske, 1975b). However, Tellervo males are not apparently attracted to any plants in this way (pers. obs. during over 4 years of field studies in NG, and lack of any reports to the contrary in the literature), which might be expected from their.lack of hair- pencils, and the presence of just sex-brands on the wings in males of only certain species. The issue is still open to speculation, however, as R. Smiles (pers. comm., 1985) noted that 1 Tellervo male came to dry (and, therefore, otherwise unattractive) artificial PA bait, placed in a trap under dense primary forest, during field trials in PNG. Also intriguing is the observation by, A. Orr (in Ackery, 1987a) that T zoilus females appeared to be more active than males, particularly while feeding on Parsonsia sap, when they use their antennae to test the stems before probing with their proboscides. In the above-mentioned chromosomal study of zoilus by Emmel et al. (1974) it was suggested from their findings that the species has a “primitive” chromosomal number: “It seems possible that the ancestors of the genus Tellervo reached Australia at a period near the beginning of differentiation within the Ithomiinae, which presumably originated from a nymphaloid ancestral stock with n = 31, the modal number within the Nymphalidae as a family and the Lepidoptera as an order.” Certainly most authors who have specialised in the study of the Ithomiinae and related groups consider Tellervo to be a ‘primitive’ genus. This is probably reflected in such morphological characters as their lack of specialised male androconia, the presence in the male genitalia of an unmodified spiniform gnathos, and an only slightly atrophied 5-segmented foreleg tarsus in the female. Van Eecke (1915b) illustrated a hypothetical wing pattern for the Tellervo ancestor. (The origin and zoogeography of Tellervo is discussed in Chapter 4.) A feature of Tellervo which is similar to that of Danainae is their utilisation of larval foodplants in the families Apocynaceae and Asclepiadaceae (see T. zoilus, Foodplants), particularly Parsonsia (Apocynaceae) which was considered by Edgar (1982, 1984) to be closely related to the ancestral foodplants of the danaines. However, the New World ithomiines are known to feed primarily on the alkaloid-rich Solanaceae (Ehrlich and Raven, 1964), as well as some on Apocynaceae (Young, 1978). For example, the co-evolutionary relationships of Neotropical ithomiine nymphalids with their solanaceous foodplants has been discussed in detail by Drummond (1986). Although correctly treated with scepticism by most, a long-perpetuated error in the literature (e.g. Okayama, 1914; Common and Waterhouse, 1981) is the suggestion that some Tellervo feed as larvae on Aristolochia (Aristolochiaceae). The various toxic secondary substances of apocynaceous and asclepiadaceous plants are known to be sequestered by danaine larvae for the chemical protection of the larva-to-adult stages of the butterflies from predators. Consequently, danaines are frequently mimicked by other Lepidoptera. Tellervo species are also apparently extensively mimicked by other Lepidoptera for the same reason (e.g. as discussed by Ackery, 1987a) (see also Chapter 8). For example, various Neptis species closely resemble T. zoilus and its relatives and, as noted by Waterhouse (1937), N. praslini even has yellow eyes in life, like those of zoilus. Tellervo adults are known to roost gregariously at night in groups of up to 8 (Lindgren, 1975), behaviour mostly associated with distasteful species. The following key to PNG Tellervo species has been modified from Ackery (1987a): 1. a) S with a well-developed FW upp cubital ‘androconial’ patch; the FW und cell basal streak, when present, usually elongate, extending from the extreme base to almost opposite the point of origin of vein CuA1 ....>2 b) 8 usually lacking such a patch; the FW und cell basal streak, when present, is usually shorter: seldom extending right to the cell base, and usually not approaching the point of origin of vein CuA1 .......... >3 2. a) HW und cell CuA1 with a pale basal marking; HW patch usually short and often somewhat rounded, occasionally divided towards the inner margin......................= zoilus b) HW und cell CuA1 uniformly dark basally; HW patch elongate, somewhat parallel-sided and usually continuous to the inner margin .....................= assarica 3. a) HW und with discal bar divided along vein CuA1, forming an isolated discal element in cell CuA1:FW postdiscals usually united to form a band from toward vein CuA1 ...............................................= heiro b) HW bar usually continuous across vein CuAj; when occasionally divided the FW postdiscals do not form a continuous band .............................................= nedusia",B_16076

Both sexes show striking individual variations in various areas, especially in the submarginal black spots on the hindwing. It belongs to the Helena subgroup of the Helena group, being replaced by oblongomaculatus, the sister species, distributed from the Moluccas to New Guinea. Formerly oblongomaculatus was included in helena, but now it is usually treated as the separate species. Its range overlaps with that of aeacus, which also belongs to the Helena group, in the Malay Peninsula and northwards, and the two resemble each other, but their males are easily separable by that the yellow marking of space 7 on the hindwing beneath basally black-striped in the upper half in helena, while the whole space is yellow in aeacus. Their females are separable by that the series of submarginal black spots are large and shifted inwards in aeacus, while they are placed near outer margin in helena. Only aeacus has the yellow marking at the base of space 7 on the hindwing above. Species of Troides are known to be non-hydrotropic by nature, but both helena and aeacus frequently alight to suck water in the districts where the draught in the dry season is so serious as to defoliate trees, for instance, N. Thailand. This species is separated into 17 subspecies, and of which 16 subspecies are known to be distributed in the area here dealt with. As for the four subspecies which are not figured in this book, references be made to D'Abrera's 'Birdwing Butterflies' which illustrates the four subspecies. Its occurence increases in number toward the wet season, but it occurs repeatedly throughout the year. It is abundant in lowland and rarely seen above the altitude of 1000 metres. Most of subspecies are generally common except the Sumbawan subspecies which we have not seen. In S. Celebes the species is not common probably because of its competition with haliphron, but is by no means rare. Butterflies are mainly in evidence in the morning and again in the evening, when they eagerly feed on flowers of tall trees. Their flights are high but slow, sometimes descending to the forest edge. The species is common and the most predominant among the species of Troides which fly together with it in Java, Borneo, N. Celebes, the Malay Peninsula, Bali, lowlands of Sumatra and Nias. The confirmed larval food plant is Aristolochia tagala. Whole individuals figured in PLATE 18 are the males of the nominate subspecies from Java, showing their striking variability. PLATE 19, 1-8 are Javan females with the same variability. PLATE 20 figures the subspecies of Bali, Lombok and Bawean, of which Bali form is hardly separable from thenominate subspecies. The Lombok form is rather long-winged and the female is strongly whitened. The Bawean form is the unique subspecies with conspicuous black spots in the golden yellow spaces on the hindwing above and the shape of the yellow area is peculiar. The female is easily identified by the much whitened ground colour and also by the brown-tinged yellow area. PLATE 21 figures the forms from Nias and Sumatra; the male is similar, while the female is variable in Nias. PLATE 22 figures the subspecies of West Malaysia and the Andamans, where the sexes are also rather variable. 6 figures the peculiar male-like female. PLATE 23 figures the subspecies from Borneo, Engano and Kangean; mosychlus (1, 2) is similar to those from the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra except that it has the rounder wing shape. Nereis from Engano (3,4) is well whitened form with clear white vein stripes on the forewing. Both sexes of antileuca from Kangean (5,6) are larger and dark, and a peculiar subspecies. Hephaestus figured in PLATE 24 is the markedly large and prominent Celebesian subspecies, the variable females ranging from the male-like dark form to the whitened form as of 5,6, but the individual of 4 is the normal one. There will be a controversy about the individual figured in PLATE 26-3, 4. Three S. Celebes ian males of this form are preserved in Tsukada Collection besides the figured ones. They have the longer forewing similar to criton rather than helena, and have the black area along the inner margin well-developed, and thus resemble criton from Halmahera. Instead of the black valva characteristic of the Haliphron group, the figured individuals have the white ones, which clearly indicate that they belong to the Helena group (especially the valva of criton is unusually black). In'this book we name them helena hephaestus and explain as a hybrid between this species and haliphron, but there remains some question as they invariably have the same wing contour and markings, in spite of the fact that several specimens were obtained in different seasons. In view of the faunastic peculiarity of Celebes, where many relics of the older age remain, they might belong to an entirely different species other than helena or criton. At present we have no female corresponding to the males. We are looking forward to checking the sex. Wallace (in Trans, Linn. Soc. Lond. 25,1865, p.39) described celebensis, a new subspecies of criton, together with leda (= hephaestus). D' Abrera treated the subspecies as that of criton in S. Celebes though he did not figure it, regarding it as the same taxon with aphimedon Boisduval and leda Staudinger. A publication of the British Museum (Natural History) relate that the male syntype was designated for the above celebensis. It is not certain whether the type from Macassar (1910), the above mentioned three specimens and the figured individual (PLATE 6-4) belong to the same taxon or not.

Both sexes show striking individual variations in various areas, especially in the submarginal black spots on the hindwing. It belongs to the Helena subgroup of the Helena group, being replaced by oblongomaculatus, the sister species, distributed from the Moluccas to New Guinea. Formerly oblongomaculatus was included in helena, but now it is usually treated as the separate species. Its range overlaps with that of aeacus, which also belongs to the Helena group, in the Malay Peninsula and northwards, and the two resemble each other, but their males are easily separable by that the yellow marking of space 7 on the hindwing beneath basally black-striped in the upper half in helena, while the whole space is yellow in aeacus. Their females are separable by that the series of submarginal black spots are large and shifted inwards in aeacus, while they are placed near outer margin in helena. Only aeacus has the yellow marking at the base of space 7 on the hindwing above. Species of Troides are known to be non-hydrotropic by nature, but both helena and aeacus frequently alight to suck water in the districts where the draught in the dry season is so serious as to defoliate trees, for instance, N. Thailand. This species is separated into 17 subspecies, and of which 16 subspecies are known to be distributed in the area here dealt with. As for the four subspecies which are not figured in this book, references be made to D'Abrera's 'Birdwing Butterflies' which illustrates the four subspecies. Its occurence increases in number toward the wet season, but it occurs repeatedly throughout the year. It is abundant in lowland and rarely seen above the altitude of 1000 metres. Most of subspecies are generally common except the Sumbawan subspecies which we have not seen. In S. Celebes the species is not common probably because of its competition with haliphron, but is by no means rare. Butterflies are mainly in evidence in the morning and again in the evening, when they eagerly feed on flowers of tall trees. Their flights are high but slow, sometimes descending to the forest edge. The species is common and the most predominant among the species of Troides which fly together with it in Java, Borneo, N. Celebes, the Malay Peninsula, Bali, lowlands of Sumatra and Nias. The confirmed larval food plant is Aristolochia tagala. Whole individuals figured in PLATE 18 are the males of the nominate subspecies from Java, showing their striking variability. PLATE 19, 1-8 are Javan females with the same variability. PLATE 20 figures the subspecies of Bali, Lombok and Bawean, of which Bali form is hardly separable from thenominate subspecies. The Lombok form is rather long-winged and the female is strongly whitened. The Bawean form is the unique subspecies with conspicuous black spots in the golden yellow spaces on the hindwing above and the shape of the yellow area is peculiar. The female is easily identified by the much whitened ground colour and also by the brown-tinged yellow area. PLATE 21 figures the forms from Nias and Sumatra; the male is similar, while the female is variable in Nias. PLATE 22 figures the subspecies of West Malaysia and the Andamans, where the sexes are also rather variable. 6 figures the peculiar male-like female. PLATE 23 figures the subspecies from Borneo, Engano and Kangean; mosychlus (1, 2) is similar to those from the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra except that it has the rounder wing shape. Nereis from Engano (3,4) is well whitened form with clear white vein stripes on the forewing. Both sexes of antileuca from Kangean (5,6) are larger and dark, and a peculiar subspecies. Hephaestus figured in PLATE 24 is the markedly large and prominent Celebesian subspecies, the variable females ranging from the male-like dark form to the whitened form as of 5,6, but the individual of 4 is the normal one. There will be a controversy about the individual figured in PLATE 26-3, 4. Three S. Celebes ian males of this form are preserved in Tsukada Collection besides the figured ones. They have the longer forewing similar to criton rather than helena, and have the black area along the inner margin well-developed, and thus resemble criton from Halmahera. Instead of the black valva characteristic of the Haliphron group, the figured individuals have the white ones, which clearly indicate that they belong to the Helena group (especially the valva of criton is unusually black). In'this book we name them helena hephaestus and explain as a hybrid between this species and haliphron, but there remains some question as they invariably have the same wing contour and markings, in spite of the fact that several specimens were obtained in different seasons. In view of the faunastic peculiarity of Celebes, where many relics of the older age remain, they might belong to an entirely different species other than helena or criton. At present we have no female corresponding to the males. We are looking forward to checking the sex. Wallace (in Trans, Linn. Soc. Lond. 25,1865, p.39) described celebensis, a new subspecies of criton, together with leda (= hephaestus). D' Abrera treated the subspecies as that of criton in S. Celebes though he did not figure it, regarding it as the same taxon with aphimedon Boisduval and leda Staudinger. A publication of the British Museum (Natural History) relate that the male syntype was designated for the above celebensis. It is not certain whether the type from Macassar (1910), the above mentioned three specimens and the figured individual (PLATE 6-4) belong to the same taxon or not.

RANGE. C. Nepal and N. India through Burma to Indochina and s. China on the continent, and from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to Sumbawa, Sulawesi and Tukangbesi in the archipelago. There are a number of subspecies in Sunda Islands (Haugum & Low, 1982-85). DISTRIBUTION AND VARIATION IN VIETNAM. Ssp. euthycrates: N. Vietnam : Cho Moi (ex coll. MNHN), Than Moi; Hanoi; Na Hang N.R., Ba Be N.P.,Tam Dao N.P., Ba Vi N.P., Cue Phuong N.P., Cat Ba N.P., Bai Tu Long N.p. C . Vietnam : Pu Huong N.R., Ben En N.P., Pu Mat N.R., Vu Quang N.R. Ssp. Cerberus: c. Vietnam : Nui Chua N.R., Bi Doup/Nui Ba N. R., Da Teh SFE. s. Vietnam : Dong Sai (ex. Metaye coll., MNHN ); Cat Tien N.p. (Cat Loc). The species is variable in size and wing pattern. In particular, the number of submarginal spots on the H W of males varies from a complete series in spaces 2-6 to entirely absent. Length of FW: [male] 65-82 mm; [female] 75-95 mm. TAXONOMIC NOTES . Following the concept offered by Haugum & Low (1978-85) type specimens of ssp. euthycrates (N. Vietnam) are rather distinctive and may be distinguished from Cerberus (S. Vietnam): “Male...fairly large, perhaps slightly lager than Cerberus... The abdomen is as in Cerberus but somewhat darker laterally and dorsally. Female... H W with a complete row of black spots, which are notably triangular and also much larger than in Cerberus... Abdomen is as in Cerberus, but darker towards base” . In reality, the females from southern populations have more oval spots while in the specimens from N. and northern part of C. Vietnam spots are more elongated and pointed (Plate l-b,d). The form azelia Jordan, mentioned by Dubois & Vitalis de Salvaza (1921) from Tonkin is the dark form of the female with an uncompleted series of black submarginal spots (the type from Khasia Hills). HABITAT AND BIOLOGY. The species is locally common at low and moderate elevations (e.g. in Ba Vi N.P.; Cat Tien N.P.). The imago feeds on flowering Mussaenda (Rubiaceae), Lantana (Verbenaceae) and Cinnamomum (Lauraceae). The larvae feed on species of Aristolochiaceae, in particular Aristolochia tagala, A. griffithi, A. indica (Chou, 2000; Igarashi & Fukuda, 2000) and Thottea seliquoia in the Malay Peninsula (Corbet & Pendlebury, 1992). The female lays eggs singly on the upper surface of leaves or on the stems (Haribal, 1992). SIMILAR SPECIES. Troides aeacus differs from T. Helena in having the marginal black markings in spaces 2 ,3 and 4 of H W inwardly bordered by a dusting of black scales. CONSERVATION STATUS. All species of this genus are included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (International commercial trade monitored through CITES permits)",B_16567

Cerberus Felder, 1864 has the following synonyms: pompeus Gray (1852); ruficollis Butler, 1877; Hephaestus Distant, 1885 (TL: Celebes), f. male Cerberus Jordan, 1908; f. male eumagos Jordan, 1908 (TL: Assam); f. female azelia Jordan, 1908 (TL: Assam); f. female gypsothelia Jordan, 1908 (TL: Tenasserim). RANGE. C. Nepal and N. India through Burma to Indochina and s. China on the continent, and from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to Sumbawa, Sulawesi and Tukangbesi in the archipelago. There are a number of subspecies in Sunda Islands (Haugum & Low, 1982-85). DISTRIBUTION AND VARIATION IN VIETNAM. Ssp. euthycrates: N. Vietnam : Cho Moi (ex coll. MNHN), Than Moi; Hanoi; Na Hang N.R., Ba Be N.P.,Tam Dao N.P., Ba Vi N.P., Cue Phuong N.P., Cat Ba N.P., Bai Tu Long N.p. C . Vietnam : Pu Huong N.R., Ben En N.P., Pu Mat N.R., Vu Quang N.R. Ssp. Cerberus: c. Vietnam : Nui Chua N.R., Bi Doup/Nui Ba N. R., Da Teh SFE. s. Vietnam : Dong Sai (ex. Metaye coll., MNHN ); Cat Tien N.p. (Cat Loc). The species is variable in size and wing pattern. In particular, the number of submarginal spots on the H W of males varies from a complete series in spaces 2-6 to entirely absent. Length of FW: [male] 65-82 mm; [female] 75-95 mm. TAXONOMIC NOTES . Following the concept offered by Haugum & Low (1978-85) type specimens of ssp. euthycrates (N. Vietnam) are rather distinctive and may be distinguished from Cerberus (S. Vietnam): “Male...fairly large, perhaps slightly lager than Cerberus... The abdomen is as in Cerberus but somewhat darker laterally and dorsally. Female... H W with a complete row of black spots, which are notably triangular and also much larger than in Cerberus... Abdomen is as in Cerberus, but darker towards base” . In reality, the females from southern populations have more oval spots while in the specimens from N. and northern part of C. Vietnam spots are more elongated and pointed (Plate l-b,d). The form azelia Jordan, mentioned by Dubois & Vitalis de Salvaza (1921) from Tonkin is the dark form of the female with an uncompleted series of black submarginal spots (the type from Khasia Hills). HABITAT AND BIOLOGY. The species is locally common at low and moderate elevations (e.g. in Ba Vi N.P.; Cat Tien N.P.). The imago feeds on flowering Mussaenda (Rubiaceae), Lantana (Verbenaceae) and Cinnamomum (Lauraceae). The larvae feed on species of Aristolochiaceae, in particular Aristolochia tagala, A. griffithi, A. indica (Chou, 2000; Igarashi & Fukuda, 2000) and Thottea seliquoia in the Malay Peninsula (Corbet & Pendlebury, 1992). The female lays eggs singly on the upper surface of leaves or on the stems (Haribal, 1992). SIMILAR SPECIES. Troides aeacus differs from T. Helena in having the marginal black markings in spaces 2 ,3 and 4 of H W inwardly bordered by a dusting of black scales. CONSERVATION STATUS. All species of this genus are included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (International commercial trade monitored through CITES permits)",B_16567

Both sexes show striking individual variations in various areas, especially in the submarginal black spots on the hindwing. It belongs to the Helena subgroup of the Helena group, being replaced by oblongomaculatus, the sister species, distributed from the Moluccas to New Guinea. Formerly oblongomaculatus was included in helena, but now it is usually treated as the separate species. Its range overlaps with that of aeacus, which also belongs to the Helena group, in the Malay Peninsula and northwards, and the two resemble each other, but their males are easily separable by that the yellow marking of space 7 on the hindwing beneath basally black-striped in the upper half in helena, while the whole space is yellow in aeacus. Their females are separable by that the series of submarginal black spots are large and shifted inwards in aeacus, while they are placed near outer margin in helena. Only aeacus has the yellow marking at the base of space 7 on the hindwing above. Species of Troides are known to be non-hydrotropic by nature, but both helena and aeacus frequently alight to suck water in the districts where the draught in the dry season is so serious as to defoliate trees, for instance, N. Thailand. This species is separated into 17 subspecies, and of which 16 subspecies are known to be distributed in the area here dealt with. As for the four subspecies which are not figured in this book, references be made to D'Abrera's 'Birdwing Butterflies' which illustrates the four subspecies. Its occurence increases in number toward the wet season, but it occurs repeatedly throughout the year. It is abundant in lowland and rarely seen above the altitude of 1000 metres. Most of subspecies are generally common except the Sumbawan subspecies which we have not seen. In S. Celebes the species is not common probably because of its competition with haliphron, but is by no means rare. Butterflies are mainly in evidence in the morning and again in the evening, when they eagerly feed on flowers of tall trees. Their flights are high but slow, sometimes descending to the forest edge. The species is common and the most predominant among the species of Troides which fly together with it in Java, Borneo, N. Celebes, the Malay Peninsula, Bali, lowlands of Sumatra and Nias. The confirmed larval food plant is Aristolochia tagala. Whole individuals figured in PLATE 18 are the males of the nominate subspecies from Java, showing their striking variability. PLATE 19, 1-8 are Javan females with the same variability. PLATE 20 figures the subspecies of Bali, Lombok and Bawean, of which Bali form is hardly separable from thenominate subspecies. The Lombok form is rather long-winged and the female is strongly whitened. The Bawean form is the unique subspecies with conspicuous black spots in the golden yellow spaces on the hindwing above and the shape of the yellow area is peculiar. The female is easily identified by the much whitened ground colour and also by the brown-tinged yellow area. PLATE 21 figures the forms from Nias and Sumatra; the male is similar, while the female is variable in Nias. PLATE 22 figures the subspecies of West Malaysia and the Andamans, where the sexes are also rather variable. 6 figures the peculiar male-like female. PLATE 23 figures the subspecies from Borneo, Engano and Kangean; mosychlus (1, 2) is similar to those from the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra except that it has the rounder wing shape. Nereis from Engano (3,4) is well whitened form with clear white vein stripes on the forewing. Both sexes of antileuca from Kangean (5,6) are larger and dark, and a peculiar subspecies. Hephaestus figured in PLATE 24 is the markedly large and prominent Celebesian subspecies, the variable females ranging from the male-like dark form to the whitened form as of 5,6, but the individual of 4 is the normal one. There will be a controversy about the individual figured in PLATE 26-3, 4. Three S. Celebes ian males of this form are preserved in Tsukada Collection besides the figured ones. They have the longer forewing similar to criton rather than helena, and have the black area along the inner margin well-developed, and thus resemble criton from Halmahera. Instead of the black valva characteristic of the Haliphron group, the figured individuals have the white ones, which clearly indicate that they belong to the Helena group (especially the valva of criton is unusually black). In'this book we name them helena hephaestus and explain as a hybrid between this species and haliphron, but there remains some question as they invariably have the same wing contour and markings, in spite of the fact that several specimens were obtained in different seasons. In view of the faunastic peculiarity of Celebes, where many relics of the older age remain, they might belong to an entirely different species other than helena or criton. At present we have no female corresponding to the males. We are looking forward to checking the sex. Wallace (in Trans, Linn. Soc. Lond. 25,1865, p.39) described celebensis, a new subspecies of criton, together with leda (= hephaestus). D' Abrera treated the subspecies as that of criton in S. Celebes though he did not figure it, regarding it as the same taxon with aphimedon Boisduval and leda Staudinger. A publication of the British Museum (Natural History) relate that the male syntype was designated for the above celebensis. It is not certain whether the type from Macassar (1910), the above mentioned three specimens and the figured individual (PLATE 6-4) belong to the same taxon or not.

RANGE. C. Nepal and N. India through Burma to Indochina and s. China on the continent, and from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to Sumbawa, Sulawesi and Tukangbesi in the archipelago. There are a number of subspecies in Sunda Islands (Haugum & Low, 1982-85). DISTRIBUTION AND VARIATION IN VIETNAM. Ssp. euthycrates: N. Vietnam : Cho Moi (ex coll. MNHN), Than Moi; Hanoi; Na Hang N.R., Ba Be N.P.,Tam Dao N.P., Ba Vi N.P., Cue Phuong N.P., Cat Ba N.P., Bai Tu Long N.p. C . Vietnam : Pu Huong N.R., Ben En N.P., Pu Mat N.R., Vu Quang N.R. Ssp. Cerberus: c. Vietnam : Nui Chua N.R., Bi Doup/Nui Ba N. R., Da Teh SFE. s. Vietnam : Dong Sai (ex. Metaye coll., MNHN ); Cat Tien N.p. (Cat Loc). The species is variable in size and wing pattern. In particular, the number of submarginal spots on the H W of males varies from a complete series in spaces 2-6 to entirely absent. Length of FW: [male] 65-82 mm; [female] 75-95 mm. TAXONOMIC NOTES . Following the concept offered by Haugum & Low (1978-85) type specimens of ssp. euthycrates (N. Vietnam) are rather distinctive and may be distinguished from Cerberus (S. Vietnam): “Male...fairly large, perhaps slightly lager than Cerberus... The abdomen is as in Cerberus but somewhat darker laterally and dorsally. Female... H W with a complete row of black spots, which are notably triangular and also much larger than in Cerberus... Abdomen is as in Cerberus, but darker towards base” . In reality, the females from southern populations have more oval spots while in the specimens from N. and northern part of C. Vietnam spots are more elongated and pointed (Plate l-b,d). The form azelia Jordan, mentioned by Dubois & Vitalis de Salvaza (1921) from Tonkin is the dark form of the female with an uncompleted series of black submarginal spots (the type from Khasia Hills). HABITAT AND BIOLOGY. The species is locally common at low and moderate elevations (e.g. in Ba Vi N.P.; Cat Tien N.P.). The imago feeds on flowering Mussaenda (Rubiaceae), Lantana (Verbenaceae) and Cinnamomum (Lauraceae). The larvae feed on species of Aristolochiaceae, in particular Aristolochia tagala, A. griffithi, A. indica (Chou, 2000; Igarashi & Fukuda, 2000) and Thottea seliquoia in the Malay Peninsula (Corbet & Pendlebury, 1992). The female lays eggs singly on the upper surface of leaves or on the stems (Haribal, 1992). SIMILAR SPECIES. Troides aeacus differs from T. Helena in having the marginal black markings in spaces 2 ,3 and 4 of H W inwardly bordered by a dusting of black scales. CONSERVATION STATUS. All species of this genus are included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (International commercial trade monitored through CITES permits)",B_16567

Both sexes show striking individual variations in various areas, especially in the submarginal black spots on the hindwing. It belongs to the Helena subgroup of the Helena group, being replaced by oblongomaculatus, the sister species, distributed from the Moluccas to New Guinea. Formerly oblongomaculatus was included in helena, but now it is usually treated as the separate species. Its range overlaps with that of aeacus, which also belongs to the Helena group, in the Malay Peninsula and northwards, and the two resemble each other, but their males are easily separable by that the yellow marking of space 7 on the hindwing beneath basally black-striped in the upper half in helena, while the whole space is yellow in aeacus. Their females are separable by that the series of submarginal black spots are large and shifted inwards in aeacus, while they are placed near outer margin in helena. Only aeacus has the yellow marking at the base of space 7 on the hindwing above. Species of Troides are known to be non-hydrotropic by nature, but both helena and aeacus frequently alight to suck water in the districts where the draught in the dry season is so serious as to defoliate trees, for instance, N. Thailand. This species is separated into 17 subspecies, and of which 16 subspecies are known to be distributed in the area here dealt with. As for the four subspecies which are not figured in this book, references be made to D'Abrera's 'Birdwing Butterflies' which illustrates the four subspecies. Its occurence increases in number toward the wet season, but it occurs repeatedly throughout the year. It is abundant in lowland and rarely seen above the altitude of 1000 metres. Most of subspecies are generally common except the Sumbawan subspecies which we have not seen. In S. Celebes the species is not common probably because of its competition with haliphron, but is by no means rare. Butterflies are mainly in evidence in the morning and again in the evening, when they eagerly feed on flowers of tall trees. Their flights are high but slow, sometimes descending to the forest edge. The species is common and the most predominant among the species of Troides which fly together with it in Java, Borneo, N. Celebes, the Malay Peninsula, Bali, lowlands of Sumatra and Nias. The confirmed larval food plant is Aristolochia tagala. Whole individuals figured in PLATE 18 are the males of the nominate subspecies from Java, showing their striking variability. PLATE 19, 1-8 are Javan females with the same variability. PLATE 20 figures the subspecies of Bali, Lombok and Bawean, of which Bali form is hardly separable from thenominate subspecies. The Lombok form is rather long-winged and the female is strongly whitened. The Bawean form is the unique subspecies with conspicuous black spots in the golden yellow spaces on the hindwing above and the shape of the yellow area is peculiar. The female is easily identified by the much whitened ground colour and also by the brown-tinged yellow area. PLATE 21 figures the forms from Nias and Sumatra; the male is similar, while the female is variable in Nias. PLATE 22 figures the subspecies of West Malaysia and the Andamans, where the sexes are also rather variable. 6 figures the peculiar male-like female. PLATE 23 figures the subspecies from Borneo, Engano and Kangean; mosychlus (1, 2) is similar to those from the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra except that it has the rounder wing shape. Nereis from Engano (3,4) is well whitened form with clear white vein stripes on the forewing. Both sexes of antileuca from Kangean (5,6) are larger and dark, and a peculiar subspecies. Hephaestus figured in PLATE 24 is the markedly large and prominent Celebesian subspecies, the variable females ranging from the male-like dark form to the whitened form as of 5,6, but the individual of 4 is the normal one. There will be a controversy about the individual figured in PLATE 26-3, 4. Three S. Celebes ian males of this form are preserved in Tsukada Collection besides the figured ones. They have the longer forewing similar to criton rather than helena, and have the black area along the inner margin well-developed, and thus resemble criton from Halmahera. Instead of the black valva characteristic of the Haliphron group, the figured individuals have the white ones, which clearly indicate that they belong to the Helena group (especially the valva of criton is unusually black). In'this book we name them helena hephaestus and explain as a hybrid between this species and haliphron, but there remains some question as they invariably have the same wing contour and markings, in spite of the fact that several specimens were obtained in different seasons. In view of the faunastic peculiarity of Celebes, where many relics of the older age remain, they might belong to an entirely different species other than helena or criton. At present we have no female corresponding to the males. We are looking forward to checking the sex. Wallace (in Trans, Linn. Soc. Lond. 25,1865, p.39) described celebensis, a new subspecies of criton, together with leda (= hephaestus). D' Abrera treated the subspecies as that of criton in S. Celebes though he did not figure it, regarding it as the same taxon with aphimedon Boisduval and leda Staudinger. A publication of the British Museum (Natural History) relate that the male syntype was designated for the above celebensis. It is not certain whether the type from Macassar (1910), the above mentioned three specimens and the figured individual (PLATE 6-4) belong to the same taxon or not.

There will be a controversy about the individual figured in PLATE 26-3, 4. Three S. Celebes ian males of this form are preserved in Tsukada Collection besides the figured ones. They have the longer forewing similar to criton rather than helena, and have the black area along the inner margin well-developed, and thus resemble criton from Halmahera. Instead of the black valva characteristic of the Haliphron group, the figured individuals have the white ones, which clearly indicate that they belong to the Helena group (especially the valva of criton is unusually black). In'this book we name them helena hephaestus and explain as a hybrid between this species and haliphron, but there remains some question as they invariably have the same wing contour and markings, in spite of the fact that several specimens were obtained in different seasons. In view of the faunastic peculiarity of Celebes, where many relics of the older age remain, they might belong to an entirely different species other than helena or criton. At present we have no female corresponding to the males. We are looking forward to checking the sex. Wallace (in Trans, Linn. Soc. Lond. 25,1865, p.39) described celebensis, a new subspecies of criton, together with leda (= hephaestus). D' Abrera treated the subspecies as that of criton in S. Celebes though he did not figure it, regarding it as the same taxon with aphimedon Boisduval and leda Staudinger. A publication of the British Museum (Natural History) relate that the male syntype was designated for the above celebensis. It is not certain whether the type from Macassar (1910), the above mentioned three specimens and the figured individual (PLATE 6-4) belong to the same taxon or not.

Both sexes show striking individual variations in various areas, especially in the submarginal black spots on the hindwing. It belongs to the Helena subgroup of the Helena group, being replaced by oblongomaculatus, the sister species, distributed from the Moluccas to New Guinea. Formerly oblongomaculatus was included in helena, but now it is usually treated as the separate species. Its range overlaps with that of aeacus, which also belongs to the Helena group, in the Malay Peninsula and northwards, and the two resemble each other, but their males are easily separable by that the yellow marking of space 7 on the hindwing beneath basally black-striped in the upper half in helena, while the whole space is yellow in aeacus. Their females are separable by that the series of submarginal black spots are large and shifted inwards in aeacus, while they are placed near outer margin in helena. Only aeacus has the yellow marking at the base of space 7 on the hindwing above. Species of Troides are known to be non-hydrotropic by nature, but both helena and aeacus frequently alight to suck water in the districts where the draught in the dry season is so serious as to defoliate trees, for instance, N. Thailand. This species is separated into 17 subspecies, and of which 16 subspecies are known to be distributed in the area here dealt with. As for the four subspecies which are not figured in this book, references be made to D'Abrera's 'Birdwing Butterflies' which illustrates the four subspecies. Its occurence increases in number toward the wet season, but it occurs repeatedly throughout the year. It is abundant in lowland and rarely seen above the altitude of 1000 metres. Most of subspecies are generally common except the Sumbawan subspecies which we have not seen. In S. Celebes the species is not common probably because of its competition with haliphron, but is by no means rare. Butterflies are mainly in evidence in the morning and again in the evening, when they eagerly feed on flowers of tall trees. Their flights are high but slow, sometimes descending to the forest edge. The species is common and the most predominant among the species of Troides which fly together with it in Java, Borneo, N. Celebes, the Malay Peninsula, Bali, lowlands of Sumatra and Nias. The confirmed larval food plant is Aristolochia tagala. Whole individuals figured in PLATE 18 are the males of the nominate subspecies from Java, showing their striking variability. PLATE 19, 1-8 are Javan females with the same variability. PLATE 20 figures the subspecies of Bali, Lombok and Bawean, of which Bali form is hardly separable from thenominate subspecies. The Lombok form is rather long-winged and the female is strongly whitened. The Bawean form is the unique subspecies with conspicuous black spots in the golden yellow spaces on the hindwing above and the shape of the yellow area is peculiar. The female is easily identified by the much whitened ground colour and also by the brown-tinged yellow area. PLATE 21 figures the forms from Nias and Sumatra; the male is similar, while the female is variable in Nias. PLATE 22 figures the subspecies of West Malaysia and the Andamans, where the sexes are also rather variable. 6 figures the peculiar male-like female. PLATE 23 figures the subspecies from Borneo, Engano and Kangean; mosychlus (1, 2) is similar to those from the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra except that it has the rounder wing shape. Nereis from Engano (3,4) is well whitened form with clear white vein stripes on the forewing. Both sexes of antileuca from Kangean (5,6) are larger and dark, and a peculiar subspecies. Hephaestus figured in PLATE 24 is the markedly large and prominent Celebesian subspecies, the variable females ranging from the male-like dark form to the whitened form as of 5,6, but the individual of 4 is the normal one.

Both sexes show striking individual variations in various areas, especially in the submarginal black spots on the hindwing. It belongs to the Helena subgroup of the Helena group, being replaced by oblongomaculatus, the sister species, distributed from the Moluccas to New Guinea. Formerly oblongomaculatus was included in helena, but now it is usually treated as the separate species. Its range overlaps with that of aeacus, which also belongs to the Helena group, in the Malay Peninsula and northwards, and the two resemble each other, but their males are easily separable by that the yellow marking of space 7 on the hindwing beneath basally black-striped in the upper half in helena, while the whole space is yellow in aeacus. Their females are separable by that the series of submarginal black spots are large and shifted inwards in aeacus, while they are placed near outer margin in helena. Only aeacus has the yellow marking at the base of space 7 on the hindwing above. Species of Troides are known to be non-hydrotropic by nature, but both helena and aeacus frequently alight to suck water in the districts where the draught in the dry season is so serious as to defoliate trees, for instance, N. Thailand. This species is separated into 17 subspecies, and of which 16 subspecies are known to be distributed in the area here dealt with. As for the four subspecies which are not figured in this book, references be made to D'Abrera's 'Birdwing Butterflies' which illustrates the four subspecies. Its occurence increases in number toward the wet season, but it occurs repeatedly throughout the year. It is abundant in lowland and rarely seen above the altitude of 1000 metres. Most of subspecies are generally common except the Sumbawan subspecies which we have not seen. In S. Celebes the species is not common probably because of its competition with haliphron, but is by no means rare. Butterflies are mainly in evidence in the morning and again in the evening, when they eagerly feed on flowers of tall trees. Their flights are high but slow, sometimes descending to the forest edge. The species is common and the most predominant among the species of Troides which fly together with it in Java, Borneo, N. Celebes, the Malay Peninsula, Bali, lowlands of Sumatra and Nias. The confirmed larval food plant is Aristolochia tagala. Whole individuals figured in PLATE 18 are the males of the nominate subspecies from Java, showing their striking variability. PLATE 19, 1-8 are Javan females with the same variability. PLATE 20 figures the subspecies of Bali, Lombok and Bawean, of which Bali form is hardly separable from thenominate subspecies. The Lombok form is rather long-winged and the female is strongly whitened. The Bawean form is the unique subspecies with conspicuous black spots in the golden yellow spaces on the hindwing above and the shape of the yellow area is peculiar. The female is easily identified by the much whitened ground colour and also by the brown-tinged yellow area. PLATE 21 figures the forms from Nias and Sumatra; the male is similar, while the female is variable in Nias. PLATE 22 figures the subspecies of West Malaysia and the Andamans, where the sexes are also rather variable. 6 figures the peculiar male-like female. PLATE 23 figures the subspecies from Borneo, Engano and Kangean; mosychlus (1, 2) is similar to those from the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra except that it has the rounder wing shape. Nereis from Engano (3,4) is well whitened form with clear white vein stripes on the forewing. Both sexes of antileuca from Kangean (5,6) are larger and dark, and a peculiar subspecies. Hephaestus figured in PLATE 24 is the markedly large and prominent Celebesian subspecies, the variable females ranging from the male-like dark form to the whitened form as of 5,6, but the individual of 4 is the normal one. There will be a controversy about the individual figured in PLATE 26-3, 4. Three S. Celebes ian males of this form are preserved in Tsukada Collection besides the figured ones. They have the longer forewing similar to criton rather than helena, and have the black area along the inner margin well-developed, and thus resemble criton from Halmahera. Instead of the black valva characteristic of the Haliphron group, the figured individuals have the white ones, which clearly indicate that they belong to the Helena group (especially the valva of criton is unusually black). In'this book we name them helena hephaestus and explain as a hybrid between this species and haliphron, but there remains some question as they invariably have the same wing contour and markings, in spite of the fact that several specimens were obtained in different seasons. In view of the faunastic peculiarity of Celebes, where many relics of the older age remain, they might belong to an entirely different species other than helena or criton. At present we have no female corresponding to the males. We are looking forward to checking the sex. Wallace (in Trans, Linn. Soc. Lond. 25,1865, p.39) described celebensis, a new subspecies of criton, together with leda (= hephaestus). D' Abrera treated the subspecies as that of criton in S. Celebes though he did not figure it, regarding it as the same taxon with aphimedon Boisduval and leda Staudinger. A publication of the British Museum (Natural History) relate that the male syntype was designated for the above celebensis. It is not certain whether the type from Macassar (1910), the above mentioned three specimens and the figured individual (PLATE 6-4) belong to the same taxon or not.

Both sexes show striking individual variations in various areas, especially in the submarginal black spots on the hindwing. It belongs to the Helena subgroup of the Helena group, being replaced by oblongomaculatus, the sister species, distributed from the Moluccas to New Guinea. Formerly oblongomaculatus was included in helena, but now it is usually treated as the separate species. Its range overlaps with that of aeacus, which also belongs to the Helena group, in the Malay Peninsula and northwards, and the two resemble each other, but their males are easily separable by that the yellow marking of space 7 on the hindwing beneath basally black-striped in the upper half in helena, while the whole space is yellow in aeacus. Their females are separable by that the series of submarginal black spots are large and shifted inwards in aeacus, while they are placed near outer margin in helena. Only aeacus has the yellow marking at the base of space 7 on the hindwing above. Species of Troides are known to be non-hydrotropic by nature, but both helena and aeacus frequently alight to suck water in the districts where the draught in the dry season is so serious as to defoliate trees, for instance, N. Thailand. This species is separated into 17 subspecies, and of which 16 subspecies are known to be distributed in the area here dealt with. As for the four subspecies which are not figured in this book, references be made to D'Abrera's 'Birdwing Butterflies' which illustrates the four subspecies. Its occurence increases in number toward the wet season, but it occurs repeatedly throughout the year. It is abundant in lowland and rarely seen above the altitude of 1000 metres. Most of subspecies are generally common except the Sumbawan subspecies which we have not seen. In S. Celebes the species is not common probably because of its competition with haliphron, but is by no means rare. Butterflies are mainly in evidence in the morning and again in the evening, when they eagerly feed on flowers of tall trees. Their flights are high but slow, sometimes descending to the forest edge. The species is common and the most predominant among the species of Troides which fly together with it in Java, Borneo, N. Celebes, the Malay Peninsula, Bali, lowlands of Sumatra and Nias. The confirmed larval food plant is Aristolochia tagala. Whole individuals figured in PLATE 18 are the males of the nominate subspecies from Java, showing their striking variability. PLATE 19, 1-8 are Javan females with the same variability. PLATE 20 figures the subspecies of Bali, Lombok and Bawean, of which Bali form is hardly separable from thenominate subspecies. The Lombok form is rather long-winged and the female is strongly whitened. The Bawean form is the unique subspecies with conspicuous black spots in the golden yellow spaces on the hindwing above and the shape of the yellow area is peculiar. The female is easily identified by the much whitened ground colour and also by the brown-tinged yellow area. PLATE 21 figures the forms from Nias and Sumatra; the male is similar, while the female is variable in Nias. PLATE 22 figures the subspecies of West Malaysia and the Andamans, where the sexes are also rather variable. 6 figures the peculiar male-like female. PLATE 23 figures the subspecies from Borneo, Engano and Kangean; mosychlus (1, 2) is similar to those from the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra except that it has the rounder wing shape. Nereis from Engano (3,4) is well whitened form with clear white vein stripes on the forewing. Both sexes of antileuca from Kangean (5,6) are larger and dark, and a peculiar subspecies. Hephaestus figured in PLATE 24 is the markedly large and prominent Celebesian subspecies, the variable females ranging from the male-like dark form to the whitened form as of 5,6, but the individual of 4 is the normal one. There will be a controversy about the individual figured in PLATE 26-3, 4. Three S. Celebes ian males of this form are preserved in Tsukada Collection besides the figured ones. They have the longer forewing similar to criton rather than helena, and have the black area along the inner margin well-developed, and thus resemble criton from Halmahera. Instead of the black valva characteristic of the Haliphron group, the figured individuals have the white ones, which clearly indicate that they belong to the Helena group (especially the valva of criton is unusually black). In'this book we name them helena hephaestus and explain as a hybrid between this species and haliphron, but there remains some question as they invariably have the same wing contour and markings, in spite of the fact that several specimens were obtained in different seasons. In view of the faunastic peculiarity of Celebes, where many relics of the older age remain, they might belong to an entirely different species other than helena or criton. At present we have no female corresponding to the males. We are looking forward to checking the sex. Wallace (in Trans, Linn. Soc. Lond. 25,1865, p.39) described celebensis, a new subspecies of criton, together with leda (= hephaestus). D' Abrera treated the subspecies as that of criton in S. Celebes though he did not figure it, regarding it as the same taxon with aphimedon Boisduval and leda Staudinger. A publication of the British Museum (Natural History) relate that the male syntype was designated for the above celebensis. It is not certain whether the type from Macassar (1910), the above mentioned three specimens and the figured individual (PLATE 6-4) belong to the same taxon or not.

Both sexes show striking individual variations in various areas, especially in the submarginal black spots on the hindwing. It belongs to the Helena subgroup of the Helena group, being replaced by oblongomaculatus, the sister species, distributed from the Moluccas to New Guinea. Formerly oblongomaculatus was included in helena, but now it is usually treated as the separate species. Its range overlaps with that of aeacus, which also belongs to the Helena group, in the Malay Peninsula and northwards, and the two resemble each other, but their males are easily separable by that the yellow marking of space 7 on the hindwing beneath basally black-striped in the upper half in helena, while the whole space is yellow in aeacus. Their females are separable by that the series of submarginal black spots are large and shifted inwards in aeacus, while they are placed near outer margin in helena. Only aeacus has the yellow marking at the base of space 7 on the hindwing above. Species of Troides are known to be non-hydrotropic by nature, but both helena and aeacus frequently alight to suck water in the districts where the draught in the dry season is so serious as to defoliate trees, for instance, N. Thailand. This species is separated into 17 subspecies, and of which 16 subspecies are known to be distributed in the area here dealt with. As for the four subspecies which are not figured in this book, references be made to D'Abrera's 'Birdwing Butterflies' which illustrates the four subspecies. Its occurence increases in number toward the wet season, but it occurs repeatedly throughout the year. It is abundant in lowland and rarely seen above the altitude of 1000 metres. Most of subspecies are generally common except the Sumbawan subspecies which we have not seen. In S. Celebes the species is not common probably because of its competition with haliphron, but is by no means rare. Butterflies are mainly in evidence in the morning and again in the evening, when they eagerly feed on flowers of tall trees. Their flights are high but slow, sometimes descending to the forest edge. The species is common and the most predominant among the species of Troides which fly together with it in Java, Borneo, N. Celebes, the Malay Peninsula, Bali, lowlands of Sumatra and Nias. The confirmed larval food plant is Aristolochia tagala. Whole individuals figured in PLATE 18 are the males of the nominate subspecies from Java, showing their striking variability. PLATE 19, 1-8 are Javan females with the same variability. PLATE 20 figures the subspecies of Bali, Lombok and Bawean, of which Bali form is hardly separable from thenominate subspecies. The Lombok form is rather long-winged and the female is strongly whitened. The Bawean form is the unique subspecies with conspicuous black spots in the golden yellow spaces on the hindwing above and the shape of the yellow area is peculiar. The female is easily identified by the much whitened ground colour and also by the brown-tinged yellow area. PLATE 21 figures the forms from Nias and Sumatra; the male is similar, while the female is variable in Nias. PLATE 22 figures the subspecies of West Malaysia and the Andamans, where the sexes are also rather variable. 6 figures the peculiar male-like female. PLATE 23 figures the subspecies from Borneo, Engano and Kangean; mosychlus (1, 2) is similar to those from the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra except that it has the rounder wing shape. Nereis from Engano (3,4) is well whitened form with clear white vein stripes on the forewing. Both sexes of antileuca from Kangean (5,6) are larger and dark, and a peculiar subspecies. Hephaestus figured in PLATE 24 is the markedly large and prominent Celebesian subspecies, the variable females ranging from the male-like dark form to the whitened form as of 5,6, but the individual of 4 is the normal one. There will be a controversy about the individual figured in PLATE 26-3, 4. Three S. Celebes ian males of this form are preserved in Tsukada Collection besides the figured ones. They have the longer forewing similar to criton rather than helena, and have the black area along the inner margin well-developed, and thus resemble criton from Halmahera. Instead of the black valva characteristic of the Haliphron group, the figured individuals have the white ones, which clearly indicate that they belong to the Helena group (especially the valva of criton is unusually black). In'this book we name them helena hephaestus and explain as a hybrid between this species and haliphron, but there remains some question as they invariably have the same wing contour and markings, in spite of the fact that several specimens were obtained in different seasons. In view of the faunastic peculiarity of Celebes, where many relics of the older age remain, they might belong to an entirely different species other than helena or criton. At present we have no female corresponding to the males. We are looking forward to checking the sex. Wallace (in Trans, Linn. Soc. Lond. 25,1865, p.39) described celebensis, a new subspecies of criton, together with leda (= hephaestus). D' Abrera treated the subspecies as that of criton in S. Celebes though he did not figure it, regarding it as the same taxon with aphimedon Boisduval and leda Staudinger. A publication of the British Museum (Natural History) relate that the male syntype was designated for the above celebensis. It is not certain whether the type from Macassar (1910), the above mentioned three specimens and the figured individual (PLATE 6-4) belong to the same taxon or not.

Both sexes show striking individual variations in various areas, especially in the submarginal black spots on the hindwing. It belongs to the Helena subgroup of the Helena group, being replaced by oblongomaculatus, the sister species, distributed from the Moluccas to New Guinea. Formerly oblongomaculatus was included in helena, but now it is usually treated as the separate species. Its range overlaps with that of aeacus, which also belongs to the Helena group, in the Malay Peninsula and northwards, and the two resemble each other, but their males are easily separable by that the yellow marking of space 7 on the hindwing beneath basally black-striped in the upper half in helena, while the whole space is yellow in aeacus. Their females are separable by that the series of submarginal black spots are large and shifted inwards in aeacus, while they are placed near outer margin in helena. Only aeacus has the yellow marking at the base of space 7 on the hindwing above. Species of Troides are known to be non-hydrotropic by nature, but both helena and aeacus frequently alight to suck water in the districts where the draught in the dry season is so serious as to defoliate trees, for instance, N. Thailand. This species is separated into 17 subspecies, and of which 16 subspecies are known to be distributed in the area here dealt with. As for the four subspecies which are not figured in this book, references be made to D'Abrera's 'Birdwing Butterflies' which illustrates the four subspecies. Its occurence increases in number toward the wet season, but it occurs repeatedly throughout the year. It is abundant in lowland and rarely seen above the altitude of 1000 metres. Most of subspecies are generally common except the Sumbawan subspecies which we have not seen. In S. Celebes the species is not common probably because of its competition with haliphron, but is by no means rare. Butterflies are mainly in evidence in the morning and again in the evening, when they eagerly feed on flowers of tall trees. Their flights are high but slow, sometimes descending to the forest edge. The species is common and the most predominant among the species of Troides which fly together with it in Java, Borneo, N. Celebes, the Malay Peninsula, Bali, lowlands of Sumatra and Nias. The confirmed larval food plant is Aristolochia tagala. Whole individuals figured in PLATE 18 are the males of the nominate subspecies from Java, showing their striking variability. PLATE 19, 1-8 are Javan females with the same variability. PLATE 20 figures the subspecies of Bali, Lombok and Bawean, of which Bali form is hardly separable from thenominate subspecies. The Lombok form is rather long-winged and the female is strongly whitened. The Bawean form is the unique subspecies with conspicuous black spots in the golden yellow spaces on the hindwing above and the shape of the yellow area is peculiar. The female is easily identified by the much whitened ground colour and also by the brown-tinged yellow area. PLATE 21 figures the forms from Nias and Sumatra; the male is similar, while the female is variable in Nias. PLATE 22 figures the subspecies of West Malaysia and the Andamans, where the sexes are also rather variable. 6 figures the peculiar male-like female. PLATE 23 figures the subspecies from Borneo, Engano and Kangean; mosychlus (1, 2) is similar to those from the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra except that it has the rounder wing shape. Nereis from Engano (3,4) is well whitened form with clear white vein stripes on the forewing. Both sexes of antileuca from Kangean (5,6) are larger and dark, and a peculiar subspecies. Hephaestus figured in PLATE 24 is the markedly large and prominent Celebesian subspecies, the variable females ranging from the male-like dark form to the whitened form as of 5,6, but the individual of 4 is the normal one. There will be a controversy about the individual figured in PLATE 26-3, 4. Three S. Celebes ian males of this form are preserved in Tsukada Collection besides the figured ones. They have the longer forewing similar to criton rather than helena, and have the black area along the inner margin well-developed, and thus resemble criton from Halmahera. Instead of the black valva characteristic of the Haliphron group, the figured individuals have the white ones, which clearly indicate that they belong to the Helena group (especially the valva of criton is unusually black). In'this book we name them helena hephaestus and explain as a hybrid between this species and haliphron, but there remains some question as they invariably have the same wing contour and markings, in spite of the fact that several specimens were obtained in different seasons. In view of the faunastic peculiarity of Celebes, where many relics of the older age remain, they might belong to an entirely different species other than helena or criton. At present we have no female corresponding to the males. We are looking forward to checking the sex. Wallace (in Trans, Linn. Soc. Lond. 25,1865, p.39) described celebensis, a new subspecies of criton, together with leda (= hephaestus). D' Abrera treated the subspecies as that of criton in S. Celebes though he did not figure it, regarding it as the same taxon with aphimedon Boisduval and leda Staudinger. A publication of the British Museum (Natural History) relate that the male syntype was designated for the above celebensis. It is not certain whether the type from Macassar (1910), the above mentioned three specimens and the figured individual (PLATE 6-4) belong to the same taxon or not.

Both sexes show striking individual variations in various areas, especially in the submarginal black spots on the hindwing. It belongs to the Helena subgroup of the Helena group, being replaced by oblongomaculatus, the sister species, distributed from the Moluccas to New Guinea. Formerly oblongomaculatus was included in helena, but now it is usually treated as the separate species. Its range overlaps with that of aeacus, which also belongs to the Helena group, in the Malay Peninsula and northwards, and the two resemble each other, but their males are easily separable by that the yellow marking of space 7 on the hindwing beneath basally black-striped in the upper half in helena, while the whole space is yellow in aeacus. Their females are separable by that the series of submarginal black spots are large and shifted inwards in aeacus, while they are placed near outer margin in helena. Only aeacus has the yellow marking at the base of space 7 on the hindwing above. Species of Troides are known to be non-hydrotropic by nature, but both helena and aeacus frequently alight to suck water in the districts where the draught in the dry season is so serious as to defoliate trees, for instance, N. Thailand. This species is separated into 17 subspecies, and of which 16 subspecies are known to be distributed in the area here dealt with. As for the four subspecies which are not figured in this book, references be made to D'Abrera's 'Birdwing Butterflies' which illustrates the four subspecies. Its occurence increases in number toward the wet season, but it occurs repeatedly throughout the year. It is abundant in lowland and rarely seen above the altitude of 1000 metres. Most of subspecies are generally common except the Sumbawan subspecies which we have not seen. In S. Celebes the species is not common probably because of its competition with haliphron, but is by no means rare. Butterflies are mainly in evidence in the morning and again in the evening, when they eagerly feed on flowers of tall trees. Their flights are high but slow, sometimes descending to the forest edge. The species is common and the most predominant among the species of Troides which fly together with it in Java, Borneo, N. Celebes, the Malay Peninsula, Bali, lowlands of Sumatra and Nias. The confirmed larval food plant is Aristolochia tagala. Whole individuals figured in PLATE 18 are the males of the nominate subspecies from Java, showing their striking variability. PLATE 19, 1-8 are Javan females with the same variability. PLATE 20 figures the subspecies of Bali, Lombok and Bawean, of which Bali form is hardly separable from thenominate subspecies. The Lombok form is rather long-winged and the female is strongly whitened. The Bawean form is the unique subspecies with conspicuous black spots in the golden yellow spaces on the hindwing above and the shape of the yellow area is peculiar. The female is easily identified by the much whitened ground colour and also by the brown-tinged yellow area. PLATE 21 figures the forms from Nias and Sumatra; the male is similar, while the female is variable in Nias. PLATE 22 figures the subspecies of West Malaysia and the Andamans, where the sexes are also rather variable. 6 figures the peculiar male-like female. PLATE 23 figures the subspecies from Borneo, Engano and Kangean; mosychlus (1, 2) is similar to those from the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra except that it has the rounder wing shape. Nereis from Engano (3,4) is well whitened form with clear white vein stripes on the forewing. Both sexes of antileuca from Kangean (5,6) are larger and dark, and a peculiar subspecies. Hephaestus figured in PLATE 24 is the markedly large and prominent Celebesian subspecies, the variable females ranging from the male-like dark form to the whitened form as of 5,6, but the individual of 4 is the normal one. There will be a controversy about the individual figured in PLATE 26-3, 4. Three S. Celebes ian males of this form are preserved in Tsukada Collection besides the figured ones. They have the longer forewing similar to criton rather than helena, and have the black area along the inner margin well-developed, and thus resemble criton from Halmahera. Instead of the black valva characteristic of the Haliphron group, the figured individuals have the white ones, which clearly indicate that they belong to the Helena group (especially the valva of criton is unusually black). In'this book we name them helena hephaestus and explain as a hybrid between this species and haliphron, but there remains some question as they invariably have the same wing contour and markings, in spite of the fact that several specimens were obtained in different seasons. In view of the faunastic peculiarity of Celebes, where many relics of the older age remain, they might belong to an entirely different species other than helena or criton. At present we have no female corresponding to the males. We are looking forward to checking the sex. Wallace (in Trans, Linn. Soc. Lond. 25,1865, p.39) described celebensis, a new subspecies of criton, together with leda (= hephaestus). D' Abrera treated the subspecies as that of criton in S. Celebes though he did not figure it, regarding it as the same taxon with aphimedon Boisduval and leda Staudinger. A publication of the British Museum (Natural History) relate that the male syntype was designated for the above celebensis. It is not certain whether the type from Macassar (1910), the above mentioned three specimens and the figured individual (PLATE 6-4) belong to the same taxon or not.

Iris, 5, p.393 (1892) marapokensis Fruhstorfer, Bed, Ent, Zeit., 43, p.419 (1898) This species is a member of the Amphrysus group and well known as an endemic species of Borneo. It prefers higher altitude compared with the rest of the congeners, having never been caught in lowland. It may be called an alpine Troides. It has been found from Mt. Kinabalu and its neighbouring mountains. It is rather small and with compact wings as is often the case with mountain species. Its markings are also peculiar, especially the characteristic white streaks on the forewing beneath are quite unique. It is scarce and counted as one of the rarities among the genus Troides. Two subspecies have been described, namely, the nominate subspecies from Mt. Kinabalu and its adjacent mountains, and marapokensis, the type locality of which is said to be Mt. Marapok of Sarawak, the other Mt. Marapokdifferent from the one to the south of Mt. Kinabalu. They are different to each other in that the male of the nominate subspecies has the forewing more pointed and smartly triangle-shaped, and the submarginal white streaks on the underside broader and triangular (pointed toward base) in shape. The mountainous area of Sarawak is difficult to approach, and for this reason the research records of the district by the Japanese are almost lacking except only few of Kuching district. No specimen of marapokensis has been brought to Japan. The sexes of andromache are quite dissimilar, the female having the upperside of forewing covered with pale brownish scale and such a type is not found in any other Troides. It is somewhat similar to the female of Ornithoptera croesus lydius in the colouring of the forewing. Its home range is at the alititude of 1000 to 2000 metres in Mt. Kinabalu, where it flies high above the canopy of the primeval forest. On Mt. Klnabalu few other Troides species occur, only helena and amphrysus being sometimes captured in Poting Hotspring district, where Troides is generally not abundant. Tetsuo Mizunuma observed this species laying eggs at Mamut mine away from Poring, and Shinji Nagai also observed the same behaviour in Headquaters. In both cases the females were laying eggs on climbing Aristolochia on huge trees, and their eggs were not obtained for climbing tree was impossible for them. Butterflies occur all the year round in Kinabalu, but the most favourable season for collecting them is from April to July. Around the end of June 1976, Tetsuo Mizunuma collected as many as forty or more. Most of them were captured at a point in a shifting farm. This ideal collecting site is a block of exposed land surrounded by heavy primeval forests, which can be reached by creeping the steep slope from the road. Tetsuo  Mizunuma, a beetle collector, found the site to collect longhorned beetles. He told us that as he was beating big fell-down timbers he was surprised by a large shadow on the white sheet he used then, and in the next second he found the shadow was that of and romache flying leisurely above. He reported that the males were particularly abundant at the site, they were flying from 10.30 to around noon, then again in the evening, and during the earlier afternoon when they were not found, the females of brookiana flew in turn. No other Troides was found there. At first he was running after them here and there, in the meantime he found that they visited Mussaenda blossom, and on this blossoming tree he collected series of them. The female flies lower than the male and is usually met with on the road or along the forest. Troides species other than andromache is hardly found at the point in Mamut too. The site in Headquaters as well as the point in Mamut is now in devastated surroundings, in fact hardly anyone succesfully collected there after 1977. As this species flies high above the canopy of the primeval forest, the capture of it is difficult unless one finds a proper point on the forest edge where Mussaenda blossoms and the species swoops down. Other species of the genus Troides with purple flush on the forewing above, are amphrysus from java and miranda from Borneo. The larval food plant undoubtedly belongs to Aristolochiaceae, but its specific name is unknown.

RANGE. C. Nepal and N. India through Burma to Indochina and s. China on the continent, and from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to Sumbawa, Sulawesi and Tukangbesi in the archipelago. There are a number of subspecies in Sunda Islands (Haugum & Low, 1982-85). DISTRIBUTION AND VARIATION IN VIETNAM. Ssp. euthycrates: N. Vietnam : Cho Moi (ex coll.

Cerberus: c. Vietnam : Nui Chua N.R., Bi Doup/Nui Ba N. R., Da Teh SFE. s. Vietnam : Dong Sai (ex. Metaye coll., MNHN ); Cat Tien N.p. (Cat Loc). The species is variable in size and wing pattern. In particular, the number of submarginal spots on the H W of males varies from a complete series in spaces 2-6 to entirely absent. Length of FW: [male] 65-82 mm; [female] 75-95 mm. TAXONOMIC NOTES . Following the concept offered by Haugum & Low (1978-85) type specimens of ssp. euthycrates (N. Vietnam) are rather distinctive and may be distinguished from Cerberus (S. Vietnam): “Male...fairly large, perhaps slightly lager than Cerberus... The abdomen is as in Cerberus but somewhat darker laterally and dorsally. Female... H W with a complete row of black spots, which are notably triangular and also much larger than in Cerberus... Abdomen is as in Cerberus, but darker towards base” . In reality, the females from southern populations have more oval spots while in the specimens from N. and northern part of C. Vietnam spots are more elongated and pointed (Plate l-b,d). The form azelia Jordan, mentioned by Dubois & Vitalis de Salvaza (1921) from Tonkin is the dark form of the female with an uncompleted series of black submarginal spots (the type from Khasia Hills). HABITAT AND BIOLOGY. The species is locally common at low and moderate elevations (e.g. in Ba Vi N.P.; Cat Tien N.P.). The imago feeds on flowering Mussaenda (Rubiaceae), Lantana (Verbenaceae) and Cinnamomum (Lauraceae). The larvae feed on species of Aristolochiaceae, in particular Aristolochia tagala, A. griffithi, A. indica (Chou, 2000; Igarashi & Fukuda, 2000) and Thottea seliquoia in the Malay Peninsula (Corbet & Pendlebury, 1992). The female lays eggs singly on the upper surface of leaves or on the stems (Haribal, 1992). SIMILAR SPECIES. Troides aeacus differs from T. Helena in having the marginal black markings in spaces 2 ,3 and 4 of H W inwardly bordered by a dusting of black scales. CONSERVATION STATUS. All species of this genus are included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (International commercial trade monitored through CITES permits)",B_16567

Mid and hind tibiae and tarsi unsealed, with shiny black surfaces. Male hindwing dorsum variable Male genitalia with eighth tergite and membrane between eighth and ninth tergites produced posteriorly as a pseuduncus, tegumen poorly developed and strongly attached to eighth tergite uncus absent; socii variable, usually immediately beneath pseuduncus and not strongly sclerotized. valvae variable. In females of Troides helena, Troides aeacus and Pacheopta aristolochiae the hindw ing dorsum is convex and weakly folded downwards. Development of the male hindwing dorsal fold is less constant than in the Graphiini. In the males of T. helena and T. aeacus the hindwing dorsum has a strong upward fold w hich contains large amounts of pale, pinkish brown scent wool but no long bristles. The dorsal margin of the fold has a strongly developed fringe of dark brown hairs. On abdominal segments 3, 4 and 5 there is a middorsal streak of specialized scales which are often abraded, even in only slightly worn specimens. The male hindwing fold of P. aristolochiae is as weak as that of the female and may be upwards or downwards. It contains neither scent wool nor bristles. The dorsal hair fringe is poorly developed and there is no area of specialized scales on the abdom en. The male of Parides alcinous has a well developed hindwing fold that contains black-brown, felt-like scent wool. Apart from Cressida Swainson (represented by one species in Australia) the Old World Troidini fall into two distinct but closely related groups. The Troides group includes the spectacular birdwings of the Papuan subregion and the Troides species with golden-yellow hindwings that range from Sulawesi and the Moluccas to as far north as the Himalayas. Members of the Parides group are smaller and predominantly black; they lack golden-yellow scales but frequently have carmine patches on the hindw ing as well as on the thorax and abdomen. The group includes Pachliopta and Parides. The larval foodplants are almost entirely Aristolochiaceae; these contain aristolochic acids, toxic substances that are selectively stored by the larvae and retained through the pupal stage into adulthood. The adults, with their yellow or carmine markings, are aposematic and act as distasteful models for several Papilionini and a few moths. The immature stages of Troides helena, T. aeacus and Pachliopta aristolochiae are known in Hong Kong. In these the eggs are smooth but thickly covered with a soft substance that appears to be identical to the cement securing the egg. In Troides it is a rich reddish brown and smoothly covers the egg like toffee on a toffee apple. In Pachliopta aristolochiae it is golden yellow and forms 14 vertical beaded ridges ending in an apical cone above the micropylar area. The substance is not water-repellent and does not cover the entire egg, so it possibly acts as either a necessary pabulum for the newly hatched larva, a chemical deterrent against parasitoids and small predators or simply as a means of rendering the otherwise white egg less conspicuous. The larvae have six rows of blunt fleshy tubercles with an extra pair on the mesothorax and metathorax. Their characteristic dark, non-reflective appearance is due to a dense carpet of extremely short hair-like cuticular processes covering all but the head, prothoracic plate and thoracic legs, which are thus shiny. The pale saddle on segments 3 and/or 4 appears in the second or third instar It is interesting to note that the Chalcosiinae (Zyygaenidae) have superficially similar tuberfled larvae and that Gynautocera papilionana (Chalcosnnae), a probable mimic of P. aristolochiae in Hong Kong, has a dull, dark larva with carmine-tipped tubercles like that of its mimetic partner The pupae have variable head horns, a dorsal thoracic hump and well developed dorsolateral abdominal tubercles or plates. Those of T. helena and P. aristolochiae arc* typical of their groups and quite dissimilar in appearance. The three Hong Kong genera are separated as follows: 1. Forewing origin of R, opposite origin of CuA Hindwing partly golden-yellow never with a tail Male hindwing dorsal fold and scent wool strongly developed Female bursa copulatrix with sclerotized areas but without a distinct signum (fig 6 33) Troides Forewing origin of R, well beyond origin of CuA Hindwing never with golden yellow scales may or may not have a tail Male hindwing dorsal fold and scent wool variably developed Female bursa copulatrix with a distinct signum (fig 6 37) 22.

Leopard. • Description. Wingspan: male 46 mm; female 46 mm. Upperside: bright orange, with numerous brown-black spot and brown-black subterminal and terminal lines. Underside: ground colour orange-brown, with brown markings, and outer half richly suffused with lilac; fore wing with a prominent dark brown subtornal spot. The sexes are best distinguished by examination of the genitalia and the fore leg. • Variation. A number of subspecies have been recognised. Only P. p. araca (Waterhouse & Lyell, 1914) is found in the Australian subregion, where it is endemic. It is quite variable in the extent of the lilac suffusion on the underside. • Similar species. None. This small northern species is distinguished by the bright orange ground colour on the upperside extensively spotted with dark markings. • Immature stages. Egg: bright yellow; with prominent longitudinal ribs. Larva: body bright green, with branched black spines; head smooth, without prominent spines, brownblack anteriorly and yellow dorsally. Pupa (Fig. 30K): 16 mm long; rich green, with golden markings; anterior end truncate, head with two dorsal golden spots and two lateral golden spots, each edged with red; thorax with two short golden conical dorsal projections edged with red, and a pair of similar dorsal spots, fore wing with a golden dorsal margin edged with red; abdominal segments 3, 5, 7 and 8 each with a golden dorsolateral conical projection tipped with black and basally edged with red. • Larval food plants. Flacourtia territorialis (Flacourtiaceae); introduced plants include Flacourtia inermis, F. rukam (Flacourtiaceae). The natural food plant is Flacourtia territorialis (listed as F. indica) (Common and Waterhouse 1981; Sankowsky 1991; Meyer 1996a), but larvae also commonly feed on ornamental F. inermis (G. Martin) and F. rukam (S. Collins) at Darwin. In captivity, larvae will also accept Scolopia braunii (C. E. Meyer). • Life cycle and behaviour. Eggs are laid singly on the young leaves and stems of the larval food plant (Common and Waterhouse 1981). The larva is very active and grows rapidly, feeding only on new soft growth. The pupa is suspended, head downwards, at an angle of about 30° to the leaf surface, attached by the cremaster beneath a leaf of the food plant. The pupa, as in Vagrans egista and Cupha prosope, is very beautiful, and in its natural surroundings is well camouflaged. Adults usually fly close to the ground near the larval food plant, bur sometimes fly rapidly near the tree tops and settle on the upper parts of the trees. Adults have been recorded during most month of the year. At the Daly River they were very abundant in May, but less oat other time of the year (J. Hutchinson 1978). They are abundant seasonally at Darwin, being most numerous in the late dry season and again after the wet season when the food plant produce copious new growth (C.E. Meyer). The life cycle at Darwin is completed in about two week (egg 2 days, larva 7 days, pupa 4 days) (Common and Waterhouse 1981). • Distribution and habitat. This species ranges widely in tropical Africa and Madagascar, from India and southern Japan, through South-east Asia to northern Australia (Common and Waterhouse 1981). P. p. araca is restricted to the northern NT, where it occurs from near the South Alligator River and Daly River north-west to Cobourg Peninsula (Common and Waterhouse 1981 ). P. phalantha is common seasonally and locally in coastal and riparian monsoon forest (vine thicket) where the natural larval food plant grows. It also breeds in suburban gardens at Darwin if the food plants are present (C.E. Meyer; T.L. Fenner).  ",B_11237

 protection derived frmo the food plant.

 their brilliant dorsal colors and the dull brown color of the hindwings, which almost completely cover the forewings when at rest.","Wing shape the same in both sexes: forewing with projected angle at apex, then a short concavity followed by a long convexity to tornus; inner margin straight.
